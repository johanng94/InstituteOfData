    "1. **Always** check a website’s **Terms and Conditions** before you scrape it. Be careful to read the statements about legal use of data. Usually, the retrieved data should not be used for commercial purposes.\n",
    "2. **Do not** request data from the website too aggressively with a program (also known as spamming), as this may break the website. Make sure the program behaves in a reasonable manner (i.e. acts like a human). One request for one webpage per second is good practice.\n",
    "3. The layout of a website may change from time to time, so make sure to revisit the site and rewrite the code as needed"

In an effort to help purge their country of strife, the twins joined <a href=\"/wiki/HYDRA\" title=\"HYDRA\">HYDRA</a> and agreed to undergo experiments with the <a href=\"/wiki/Scepter\" title=\"Scepter\">Scepter</a> under the supervision of <a href=\"/wiki/Wolfgang_von_Strucker\" title=\"Wolfgang von Strucker\">Wolfgang von Strucker</a>. While her brother developed super-speed, Wanda attained various abilities including telekinesis, telepathy, and reality manipulation. When HYDRA <a href=\"/wiki/Attack_on_the_HYDRA_Research_Base\" title=\"Attack on the HYDRA Research Base\">fell</a>, the twins joined <a href=\"/wiki/Ultron\" title=\"Ultron\">Ultron</a> to get their revenge on <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Tony_Stark\" title=\"Tony Stark\">Tony Stark</a> over his weapons killing their family in a bombing, but eventually abandoned him when they discovered Ultron's true intentions to <a href=\"/wiki/Ultron_Offensive\" title=\"Ultron Offensive\">destroy</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Earth\" title=\"Earth\">Earth</a>.

       "<p>Due to childhood trauma from seeing her parents killed right in front of her, and the constant war-like state of her home, Wanda Maximoff had developed a very aggressive personality. From being involved in protests to volunteering for <a href=\"/wiki/Wolfgang_von_Strucker\" title=\"Wolfgang von Strucker\">Wolfgang von Strucker</a>'s experiments, and joining the <a href=\"/wiki/Avengers\" title=\"Avengers\">Avengers</a>, Maximoff has shown that she prefers to fight directly for what she believes in. Her passionate nature and willingness to engage in violence to achieve her goals led her to mistakenly side with <a href=\"/wiki/Ultron\" title=\"Ultron\">Ultron</a>, which deeply influenced much of her future actions.\n",
       "</p><p>Her passion was partly fueled by her hatred of the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_of_America\" title=\"United States of America\">United States of America</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Tony_Stark\" title=\"Tony Stark\">Tony Stark</a> and was strong enough to have her side with Ultron for what she believed to be the greater good. She was unfazed when Ultron killed von Strucker and was willing to send Hulk on a <a href=\"/wiki/Duel_of_Johannesburg\" title=\"Duel of Johannesburg\">rampage</a> in Johannesburg, costing the lives of both soldiers and civilians. Fortunately, she was not blinded completely by passion and was capable of reason, clearly being appalled by the level of destruction Ultron was trying to achieve, and promptly sided with the Avengers to make amends. After getting to know the Avengers, she has since let go of any grudge or hatred she previously held against the team as well as the United States.\n",
       "</p><p>Due to her past affiliation with Ultron and her role in the destruction of Sokovia, Maximoff carried a deep fear of making mistakes and was frequently wracked with guilt and remorse. Her self-doubt and guilt over the mistakes she has made have at times led her to inaction, even though she is generally action-oriented. Despite this, Hawkeye was able to talk her into action, affirming her desire to fight for what she feels is right, despite what others may think of her.\n",
       "</p><p>In contrast with her brother, Scarlet Witch displays a more serious attitude and direct anger, not only against Tony Stark but against anyone that she perceives as her enemy, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Ulysses_Klaue\" title=\"Ulysses Klaue\">Klaue</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Thanos\" title=\"Thanos\">Thanos</a>. Her anger leads her to be vengeful, as demonstrated when she volunteered for experiments to become a weapon against the United States and Tony Stark, seeking out <a href=\"/wiki/Ultron\" title=\"Ultron\">Ultron</a>'s primary body in order to destroy him after he caused the death of her brother, and angrily telling <a href=\"/wiki/Thanos\" title=\"Thanos\">Thanos</a> that he could not understand her pain after she was forced to kill <a href=\"/wiki/Vision\" title=\"Vision\">Vision</a> in the attempt to stop him. In the past, she had no qualms about manipulating others mentally in order to achieve what she wanted, though she later regretted doing this.\n",
       "</p><p>Maximoff became considerably more mellow after joining the team, as she is seen to be more compassionate, level-headed, and less inclined to use the manipulative aspects of her abilities, such as fear projection and mind control. Driven by a desire to fight in the front lines rather than as passive support, Maximoff honed her powers to become more combat-oriented, focusing on energy blasts, throws, and barrier projection, relying less on her telepathic abilities. Having become less aggressive and more reluctant to do harm, she has not been seen using her mental manipulation powers since joining the Avengers. Additionally, she rarely uses her powers to deal out lethal force unless completely necessary, using her powers more often to incapacitate her opponents. However, she also is less inclined to hold back in a fight, even against fellow Avengers, as shown when she hurled <a href=\"/wiki/Black_Widow\" title=\"Black Widow\">Black Widow</a> several feet when she attempted to overpower Hawkeye. She has shown a willingness to kill her enemies in extreme circumstances, as shown when she telekinetically threw a carving knife at a perceived assailant before realizing it was Hawkeye, and when she purposefully lifted <a href=\"/wiki/Proxima_Midnight\" title=\"Proxima Midnight\">Proxima Midnight</a> into a <a href=\"/wiki/Thresher\" title=\"Thresher\">Thresher</a> and shredded her to stop the latter from killing Black Widow.\n",
       "</p><p>Maximoff grew to care for <a href=\"/wiki/Vision\" title=\"Vision\">Vision</a> during their time together. She was, however, disappointed that he was more loyal to Stark and the people of Earth than to her. However, in the aftermath of <a href=\"/wiki/Avengers_Civil_War\" title=\"Avengers Civil War\">Avengers Civil War</a>, she has put the grudge aside and developed strong romantic feelings for him to the point that, after she <a href=\"/wiki/Escape_from_the_Raft\" title=\"Escape from the Raft\">escaped</a> from the <a href=\"/wiki/Raft\" title=\"Raft\">Raft</a>, she went off the grid with him to Europe and was in the beginning stages of starting a new life with him. Her feelings grew strong to the point that she tried her best to protect him from <a href=\"/wiki/Thanos\" title=\"Thanos\">Thanos</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Black_Order\" title=\"Black Order\">Black Order</a> despite being at a great disadvantage, and refused to kill him until there was no alternative, resisting even when he himself agreed that his death was for the greater good of the universe. When forced to kill him, Maximoff openly wept as she was killing the being she loved more than anything else. Maximoff was horrified when <a href=\"/wiki/Vision\" title=\"Vision\">Vision</a> was briefly resurrected and emotionally devastated when he was killed a second time by Thanos, sitting at his side in mourning minutes before her death.\n",
       "</p><p>While initially hostile during the conflict with Ultron, Maximoff grew to have a strong bond with Hawkeye, who serves as a brotherly figure in her life, especially after losing Pietro. Hawkeye was responsible for encouraging her to act in two separate situations where she is overcome by her guilt, that being the attack on Sokovia and his attempt to extract her from the Avengers' Compound. In the aftermath of the Battle of Earth, where Hawkeye was in need of comfort after losing Black Widow, Maximoff was there, by his side, to quiet his worries.\n",
       "</p><p>Upon coming back to life and returning to Earth to fight against Thanos and his armies, Maximoff displayed an overwhelming vehemence towards the alien warlord, tempered by a subtle confidence. Her presence and movements were more deliberate and forceful, unlike the relative apprehension she displayed in her earlier appearances. This was most evident when Thanos was trying to break through her protections, Maximoff gave him an almost mocking smirk before forcefully swatting away his weapon with relative ease.\n",

Her power signature is similar to that of the Mind Stone, as she gained her powers from it. Maximoff's powers are reliant on movement and focus, which means her enemies or opponents can stop her from using her powers by disrupting her concentration or restricting her movement. <a href=\"/wiki/War_Machine\" title=\"War Machine\">War Machine</a> was able to incapacitate her momentarily using a sonic cannon and her powers were restricted with a straitjacket and specialized collar during her time on the <a href=\"/wiki/Raft\" title=\"Raft\">Raft</a>. During the <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Wakanda\" title=\"Battle of Wakanda\">Battle of Wakanda</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Proxima_Midnight\" title=\"Proxima Midnight\">Proxima Midnight</a> was able to ambush Maximoff by striking her on the head with the hilt of her sword, which disrupted Maximoff's focus and stopped her from using her powers momentarily. During the <a href=\"/wiki/Battle_of_Earth\" title=\"Battle of Earth\">Battle of Earth</a>, Wanda's powers had grown so strong that she was able to single-handedly defeat <a href=\"/wiki/Thanos\" title=\"Thanos\">Thanos</a>, a feat that <a href=\"/wiki/Iron_Man\" title=\"Iron Man\">Iron Man</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Thor\" title=\"Thor\">Thor</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Captain_America\" title=\"Captain America\">Captain America</a> via <a href=\"/wiki/Mj%C3%B8lnir\" title=\"Mjølnir\">Mjølnir</a> failed to accomplish. These enhanced powers are magical in nature, although she has never received formal training, making them unrefined, especially when compared to <a href=\"/wiki/Doctor_Strange\" title=\"Doctor Strange\">Doctor Strange</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-Kevin_Fiege_19-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Kevin_Fiege-19\">[19]</a></sup>\n",

This energy manifests in any shape or form, outlining her telekinetic spheres of influence, as the energy is visible in a reddish color. When her energy hits a target, she can use her telekinesis to inflict further damage. Sometimes, Maximoff will lose control of her powers due to emotional turmoil, such as when she unleashed a wave of red psionic force that tore apart and disintegrated surrounding <a href=\"/wiki/Ultron_Sentries\" title=\"Ultron Sentries\">Ultron sentries</a> when she sensed her brother <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Pietro_Maximoff\" title=\"Pietro Maximoff\">Pietro Maximoff's</a> death, letting out a scream of anguish. Maximoff proved herself capable of destroying the Mind Stone, due to her powers having a similar energy signature. She could also use her psionic energy streams to enhance the powers behind her attacks, such as when she first used her telekinesis to bring <a href=\"/wiki/Vision\" title=\"Vision\">Vision</a> to his knees and then use a dense stream of energy to force him through several floors and several feet into the ground. During the <a href=\"/wiki/Attack_on_Vision\" title=\"Attack on Vision\">attack on Vision</a>, Maximoff utilized this power to knock back Proxima Midnight and <a href=\"/wiki/Corvus_Glaive\" title=\"Corvus Glaive\">Corvus Glaive</a> using a bolt of psionic energy, and later used another blast to throw Corvus Glaive through the wall of a bell tower. She also showed the capability of multitasking while using her abilities, as she simultaneously held back <a href=\"/wiki/Thanos\" title=\"Thanos\">Thanos</a> with a stream from one hand while destroying the Mind Stone with a stream of energy from her other hand. She was also able to use her telekinesis with one hand to stop Thanos' <a href=\"/wiki/Double-Edged_Sword\" title=\"Double-Edged Sword\">sword</a> in midair while also using a powerful energy blast with her other hand to cleave it into two pieces. In her second encounter with Thanos, Maximoff's energy blasts were powerful enough to force the Mad Titan to go on the defensive against her and were enough to knock him back and make him stumble backwards even when he blocked them with his sword. Maximoff was also able to push <a href=\"/wiki/Monica_Rambeau\" title=\"Monica Rambeau\">Monica Rambeau</a> out of her reality with a powerful energy blast that sent her through several walls, including the barrier that divides <a href=\"/wiki/Westview\" title=\"Westview\">Westview</a> from the outside world; while leaving Rambeau completely physically unharmed and send \"Pietro Maximoff\" flying with a powerful blast. She can also utilize her psionic energy in a neurological way to manipulate the thoughts and memories of others, akin to telepathy.\n",
       "<ul><li><b>Telekinesis</b>: Maximoff has the ability to move, levitate and otherwise manipulate objects using her psionic energy in a remote manner without the need for her energy to first be projected from her hands. Maximoff uses this energy to affect and control molecules and particles, allowing her to fully control matter and energy. Maximoff started training this power by moving wooden blocks around while imprisoned in <a href=\"/wiki/Wolfgang_von_Strucker\" title=\"Wolfgang von Strucker\">Wolfgang von Strucker</a>'s secret <a href=\"/wiki/HYDRA_Research_Base\" title=\"HYDRA Research Base\">facility</a>. Maximoff pulled them apart with her power, and suspended them in the air. Maximoff used this power to stop an off-rail train in Seoul, tear apart <a href=\"/wiki/Ultron_Sentries\" title=\"Ultron Sentries\">Ultron sentries</a> and rip out the central processor of <a href=\"/wiki/Ultron\" title=\"Ultron\">Ultron</a>'s primary body, which was made of vibranium. Maximoff's telekinesis can control a soldier's gunfire and throw him away, lift <a href=\"/wiki/Captain_America\" title=\"Captain America\">Captain America</a> into the air to enter a building, hurl aside <a href=\"/wiki/Black_Widow\" title=\"Black Widow\">Black Widow</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Black_Panther\" title=\"Black Panther\">Black Panther</a>, hurl cars at <a href=\"/wiki/Iron_Man\" title=\"Iron Man\">Iron Man</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Spider-Man\" title=\"Spider-Man\">Spider-Man</a>, extract and dissipate an enormous amount of gas, and even hold up a collapsed watchtower for several minutes to allow Captain America and Bucky to escape. Maximoff was also capable of using her energy to slow the chemical reaction within Crossbone's explosive vest by reducing the particles' kinetic energy on a molecular level, although it caused her great strain due to the massive energy the reaction induced once it had started. She was even able to bring the immensely powerful <a href=\"/wiki/Vision\" title=\"Vision\">Vision</a> to his knees and blast him vertically down through a building's many floors. Her telekinesis is powerful enough to bend <a href=\"/wiki/Vibranium\" title=\"Vibranium\">vibranium</a>, as she managed to rip open the chest of <a href=\"/wiki/Ultron\" title=\"Ultron\">Ultron</a>'s damaged primary body to summon his central processor to her hand, and was even strong enough to shatter the Mind Stone. She was also able to stop a massive line of <a href=\"/wiki/Thresher\" title=\"Thresher\">Threshers</a> and redirect them at Thanos' <a href=\"/wiki/Outriders\" title=\"Outriders\">Outriders</a>, as well as hold back a <a href=\"/wiki/Chitauri\" title=\"Chitauri\">Chitauri</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Leviathans\" title=\"Leviathans\">Leviathan</a>. During her second fight with <a href=\"/wiki/Thanos\" title=\"Thanos\">Thanos</a>, she lifted and flung large portions of debris at him. She then was able to use her telekinesis to hold back Thanos' sword even with the Titan using both of his arms in an attempt to overpower her, and was able to weaken its structural integrity, causing cracks to appear in it, before finally using an energy blast to cleave it in two. She then incapacitated him by lifting him into the air and began to crush his body, snapping off significant portions of his armor. She displayed great degrees of precision with her telekinesis, such as when she used it to heal <a href=\"/wiki/Vision\" title=\"Vision\">Vision</a> by telekinetically repairing his body on a molecular level. Maximoff was also precise enough to use her energy to remove a copious volume of poisonous gas by spreading her energy throughout every molecule of gas and making it dissipate into the atmosphere. Maximoff was able to use her telekinesis to organize the dishes in her kitchen, use it to help herself handle all the kitchen items while preparing a dinner, rebuild part of her <a href=\"/wiki/Vision_Residence\" title=\"Vision Residence\">house</a> after having expelled <a href=\"/wiki/Monica_Rambeau\" title=\"Monica Rambeau\">Monica Rambeau</a>, lift Rambeau into the air to get her out of her house before dropping her to the ground, open a door in <a href=\"/wiki/S.W.O.R.D._Headquarters\" title=\"S.W.O.R.D.

She used it to grab and break apart targets, protect others from enemy fire, contain a target or to cover and deflect attacks from enemies, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Ultron_Sentries\" title=\"Ultron Sentries\">Ultron's sentries</a>. Like any physical barriers, the barrier could be broken with extreme brute force, as the Sentries were able to eventually break it. During her time as an Avenger, Maximoff learned to project her energy around herself, constructing a close-to-the-body psionic armor to protect herself from extreme impacts, such as falls from great heights or blows from superhumanly strong combatants, increasing her durability to a significant degree. This allowed her to land safely whenever she crash lands, as well as defending her against the might of superhuman combatants, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Proxima_Midnight\" title=\"Proxima Midnight\">Proxima Midnight</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Corvus_Glaive\" title=\"Corvus Glaive\">Corvus Glaive</a> who sent her and <a href=\"/wiki/Vision\" title=\"Vision\">Vision</a> crashing through a glass roof after being shot down by <a href=\"/wiki/Proxima_Midnight%27s_Spear\" title=\"Proxima Midnight's Spear\">Proxima Midnight's spear</a>.</li>\n",
       "<li><b>Flight</b>: Maximoff is able to use this power to move through the air and simulate flight, in order to hover and safely float back to the ground. The use of this power manifests as a blast of psionic energy expelled from her hands onto the ground to propel herself up in the air, with a second blast used to slow her momentum as she approaches ground allowing her to land safely. It operates more like an enhanced leap similarly to <a href=\"/wiki/Hulk\" title=\"Hulk\">Hulk</a>, thanks to the force of gravity pushing her down. Maximoff's power grew over time to the point where she could project herself, along with Vision, far higher into the air and for much longer than before. After her resurrection and empowerment, she was able to effortlessly levitate several feet into the air while simultaneously lifting two massive pieces of rubble, no longer needing to actively project energy from her hands to levitate herself, and later flew through the air to intercept a Leviathan before it could attack <a href=\"/wiki/Valkyrie\" title=\"Valkyrie\">Valkyrie</a>. During her discussion with <a class=\"new\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvVmlzaW9uL0NoYW9zX01hZ2ljX1JlY3JlYXRpb24/YWN0aW9uPWVkaXQmcmVkbGluaz0x\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Vision/Chaos Magic Recreation (page does not exist)\">Vision</a>, Maximoff was able to float without being propelled by her psionic energy.</li>\n",

This power can be hypnotic in nature as shown when she used it against the <a href=\"/wiki/Avengers\" title=\"Avengers\">Avengers</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/South_Africa\" title=\"South Africa\">South Africa</a>, placing them in a sort of trance while she viewed the Avengers' memories. When using her power, her irises sometimes glow a dark reddish color, especially when she concentrates it on specific targets. She was able to use this ability to cripple the <a href=\"/wiki/Avengers\" title=\"Avengers\">Avengers</a>, forcing them each to recall the darker events of their pasts and placing them inside daydream-like visions that rendered them nearly helpless. When this ability is in use, Maximoff's reddish energy takes a more mist-like form, floating into the head of the victim in the form of neurons. The effects also distort the victim's iris coloration, causing them to shine a dark reddish color. This also allows her to control other people's actions, as she did with a considerable number of civilians in <a href=\"/wiki/Sokovia\" title=\"Sokovia\">Sokovia</a> to aid in their evacuation, causing them to experience a form of sleepwalking and making them all get up and leave the city. Maximoff's mental power is even strong enough to reverse the effects of the <a href=\"/wiki/Mind_Stone\" title=\"Mind Stone\">Mind Stone</a>, one of the most powerful objects in existence, as shown when she freed <a href=\"/wiki/Helen_Cho\" title=\"Helen Cho\">Helen Cho</a> from the stone's control. She can also manipulate the memory, thoughts, actions, emotions, and senses of others at will, as well as to induce sleep or pain and create illusions without any difficulty. After her change of allegiance, she is no longer shown using this area of her powers. Maximoff could use her telepathy to affect the Mind Stone, such as when she forced used her power to make Vision phase through <a href=\"/wiki/Hawkeye\" title=\"Hawkeye\">Hawkeye</a> to release him. Maximoff can also use her psionic energy to read the <a href=\"/wiki/Mind_Stone\" title=\"Mind Stone\">Mind Stone</a> and state that she felt Vision's consciousness. Maximoff was able to use this power to cause several <a href=\"/wiki/S.W.O.R.D.\" title=\"S.W.O.R.D.\">S.W.O.R.D.</a> agents to point their guns at <a href=\"/wiki/Tyler_Hayward\" title=\"Tyler Hayward\">Tyler Hayward</a>.</li>\n",
       "<li><b>Emotional Manipulation</b>: With her mental powers, Maximoff often used it in order to elicit fear or emotional pain in a person in the form of nightmarish hallucinations that could stun and weaken even an individual as powerful as <a href=\"/wiki/Thor\" title=\"Thor\">Thor</a>. These visions can depict things that a person fears, regrets, or general disturbances, though the nature of it is not up to Maximoff. She does seem to be able to know what her victim is seeing and be inside the vision with them without them being aware of her presence.</li></ul></li>\n",
       "<li><b>Telepathy</b>: Due to her ability to interact mentally with others, Maximoff can read minds, communicate telepathically and experience the memories and thoughts of others. She also used this ability to temporarily see into <a href=\"/wiki/Ultron\" title=\"Ultron\">Ultron</a>'s mind whilst he was uploading his consciousness into the android body of what would later become Vision and it was thanks to this that she was able to discover his genocidal intentions and rebel against him. Maximoff can also sense the minds and emotions of those around her as she could see Stark's fear in their first encounter and sensed <a href=\"/wiki/Quicksilver\" title=\"Quicksilver\">Quicksilver</a>'s death, knowing exactly what happened to him as if she had been there in person.</li></ul></li></ul>\n",

Able to harness <a href=\"/wiki/Magic\" title=\"Magic\">Chaos Magic</a>, Maximoff was the realisation of the myth of the Scarlet Witch, a being capable of spontaneous creation. Her magic is primarily composed of the same red energy that powers her psionic powers, although certain abilities within the <a href=\"/wiki/Westview_Anomaly\" title=\"Westview Anomaly\">Hex</a> could also be used with no apparent energy discharge.\n",
       "<ul><li><b>Reality Manipulation</b>: Maximoff can warp reality. She accomplishes this by manipulating molecular polarity, allowing her numerous other capabilities. Maximoff's reality warping abilities began initially on a small scale. However, as time progressed, her  powers have grown exponentially. Using this power, Maximoff was able to take control of <a href=\"/wiki/Westview\" title=\"Westview\">Westview</a> by placing a hexagonal force field around the town called the <a href=\"/wiki/Westview_Anomaly\" title=\"Westview Anomaly\">Hex</a>, which emits a type of radiation known as <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background\" title=\"wikipedia:Cosmic microwave background\">CMBR</a>, a remnant radiation from the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang\" title=\"wikipedia:Big Bang\">Big Bang</a>. Inside the Hex, Maximoff has absolute power and can change anything to suit her thinking, being able to create a perfect world based on classic sitcoms, as well as use her powers to rewrite reality and make any person and any object  adapt to the time in which they were live in Westview, demonstrated when she had <a href=\"/wiki/Monica_Rambeau\" title=\"Monica Rambeau\">Monica Rambeau</a>'s bulletproof vest changed to fit the clothing of her world of classic sitcoms. In fact, every rewritten object inside the Hex, when it exits Westview, remains the same as it was inside. Although at first the Hex was only found around Westview, when <a class=\"new\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvVmlzaW9uL0NoYW9zX01hZ2ljX1JlY3JlYXRpb24/YWN0aW9uPWVkaXQmcmVkbGluaz0x\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Vision/Chaos Magic Recreation (page does not exist)\">Vision</a> came out of the barrier and nearly died, Maximoff expanded the Hex to save him, also causing everything in his path to be rewritten, transforming the <a href=\"/wiki/S.W.O.R.D.\" title=\"S.W.O.R.D.\">S.W.O.R.D.</a> <a href=\"/wiki/S.W.O.R.D._Response_Base\" title=\"S.W.O.R.D.

However, with years of experience, she developed a fighting style in which she would infuse her psionic energy into her hands to greatly enhance her hand-to-hand combat skills and allow her to parry attacks from bladed weapons without suffering any harm due to her psionic energy protecting her hands from damage. Her combat instincts were also honed to the point she could react to and halt an explosion, parry attacks from <a href=\"/wiki/Proxima_Midnight\" title=\"Proxima Midnight\">Proxima Midnight</a>, and catch Thanos' <a href=\"/wiki/Double-Edged_Sword\" title=\"Double-Edged Sword\">double-edged sword</a> moments before it could strike her.

But, after this... I am something else. And still me, I think. But that\\'s not what everyone else sees.\"\\n―Wanda Maximoff to Vision[src]\\nWanda Maximoff is a native of Sokovia who grew up with her fraternal twin brother, Pietro. In an effort to help purge their country of strife, the twins joined HYDRA and agreed to undergo experiments with the Scepter under the supervision of Wolfgang von Strucker. While her brother developed super-speed, Wanda attained various abilities including telekinesis, telepathy, and reality manipulation. When HYDRA fell, the twins joined Ultron to get their revenge on Tony Stark over his weapons killing their family in a bombing, but eventually abandoned him when they discovered Ultron\\'s true intentions to destroy Earth. Wanda and Pietro fought with the Avengers during the Battle of Sokovia to stop Ultron; Pietro was killed during the battle but Wanda survived, and shortly after Ultron\\'s destruction, became a member of the Avengers.\\nDuring the Avengers Civil War, she sided with Captain America and was briefly imprisoned in the Raft before Rogers freed her along with his teammates. Over the next two years, Maximoff reunited and reconciled with Vision, and together the two started living off the grid in Europe, forming a romantic relationship. However, the two soon came under threat from Thanos and the Black Order, who sought the Mind Stone. After being ambushed by the Order, they sought refuge in Wakanda with the remaining Avengers. Maximoff partook in the city\\'s defense when the Order invaded the city, but died in the Snap after Thanos completed the Infinity Gauntlet. After the effects of the Snap were undone in 2023, Maximoff was among the many heroes who fought during the Battle of Earth, defeating Thanos and his armies.\\nSoon after, Maximoff became overwhelmed by immense grief from her recent personal losses. In her sorrow, she generated an illusionary world of classical sitcom tropes, which she wove around the town of Westview, enthralling its unconsenting inhabitants as cast members and cutting the town off from the outside world. With a recreated Vision as her husband, Maximoff used her powers to generate the ideal life for herself, even producing twin sons, Tommy and Billy. However, the outside world quickly became aware of the event and began making attempts to break through the illusion, putting Wanda\\'s paradise at risk. Only further complicating the crisis was Agatha Harkness, a sorceress who sought to understand the nature of Wanda\\'s illusion.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Biography\\n\\n1.1 Early Life\\n\\n1.1.1 A Love for Sitcoms\\n1.1.2 Novi Grad Bombings\\n1.1.3 Protesting Against Heroes\\n\\n\\n1.2 Avengers Conflict\\n\\n1.2.1 Joining HYDRA\\n1.2.2 Attack on the Research Base\\n1.2.3 Joining Ultron\\n1.2.4 Battle at the Salvage Yard\\n1.2.5 Ultron\\'s Intentions Revealed\\n1.2.6 Battle of Seoul\\n\\n\\n1.3 Changing Sides\\n\\n1.3.1 The Birth of Vision\\n1.3.2 Battle of Sokovia\\n1.3.3 Rescued by Hawkeye\\n1.3.4 Becoming an Avenger\\n1.3.5 Protecting the Key\\n1.3.6 Quicksilver\\'s Sacrifice\\n\\n\\n1.4 New Avengers\\n\\n1.4.1 Moving to the United States\\n1.4.2 Bonding with Vision\\n1.4.3 Lagos Catastrophe\\n1.4.4 Feeling the Guilt\\n\\n\\n1.5 Avengers Civil War\\n\\n1.5.1 Sokovia Accords\\n1.5.2 Rescued by Hawkeye\\n1.5.3 Recruiting Scott Lang\\n1.5.4 Clash of the Avengers\\n1.5.5 Fighting Former Teammates\\n1.5.6 Winning a Losing Battle\\n1.5.7 Imprisoned in the Raft\\n\\n\\n1.6 Infinity War\\n\\n1.6.1 Attack on Vision\\n1.6.2 Trying to Save Vision\\n1.6.3 Battle of Wakanda\\n1.6.4 Thanos\\' Victory\\n1.6.5 Battle of Earth\\n1.6.6 Remembering the Fallen\\n\\n\\n1.7 WandaVision\\n\\n1.7.1 Wanting Vision Back\\n1.7.2 Living in Suburbia\\n1.7.3 The Magic Show\\n1.7.4 Sudden Pregnancy\\n1.7.5 Ejecting Geraldine\\n1.7.6 Raising Tommy and Billy\\n1.7.7 Confronting S.W.O.R.D.\\n1.7.8 Vision\\'s Confrontation\\n1.7.9 Halloween\\n1.7.10 Expanding the Hex\\n1.7.11 Losing Control\\n1.7.12 Learning the Truth\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2 Personality\\n3 Powers and Abilities\\n\\n3.1 Powers\\n3.2 Abilities\\n\\n\\n4 Equipment\\n\\n4.1 Uniform\\n4.2 Vehicles\\n\\n\\n5 Facilities\\n\\n5.1 Prisons\\n\\n\\n6 Relationships\\n\\n6.1 Family\\n6.2 Allies\\n6.3 Enemies\\n\\n\\n7 Appearances\\n8 Trivia\\n9 Behind the Scenes\\n10 References\\n11 External Links\\n\\n\\nBiography\\nEarly Life\\nA Love for Sitcoms\\n\\n\"So, what I see here is a baby witch obsessed with sitcoms.\"\\n―Agatha Harkness to Wanda Maximoff[src]\\nWanda Maximoff was born in 1989 in Sokovia to Oleg and Iryna Maximoff along with her twin brother, Pietro.[8] Unknown to any of them, Maximoff was born with latent magical abilities. Growing up, her family would watch American by-products such as television series and sitcoms to practice their English. Maximoff became incredibly fond of the sitcoms, in particular, The Dick Van Dyke Show, enjoying and desiring the idyllic lives they depicted.[1]\\n\\nNovi Grad Bombings\\n     Maximoff watching sitcoms with her family  \\n\\n\"Born in 1989 to Iryna and Oleg Maximoff, both killed during an air raid when Maximoff and her twin brother, Pietro, were 10.\"\\n―Jimmy Woo[src]\\nAt the age of 10, during the violent bombings in Sokovia, when her father got home, Maximoff chose for her family to watch The Dick Van Dyke Show for TV night, as it was her favorite. Suddenly, a mortar shell hit their apartment building, instantly killing Maximoff\\'s parents.\\n\\n     The Maximoff twins survive the bombing  \\nTrapped inside the crumbling building, Pietro Maximoff moved himself and his sister under the bed, where they witnessed a second shell land three feet in front of them. Maximoff noticed the TV still playing, so she used it to comfort her.[1] For the next two days, the twins stared at the shell, reading the name Stark Industries on it, fearing it would detonate at any moment, but it did not, and they were rescued.[3] Maximoff and Pietro were subsequently admitted into a Sokovian orphanage. While there, they lived and interacted with a child who had a skin condition, which was particularly memorable for Maximoff.[9]\\n\\nProtesting Against Heroes\\n\\n\"We\\'re not at war, Captain.\"\"They are.\"\\n―Maria Hill and Captain America[src]\\n     Wanda and Pietro Maximoff attend a protest  \\nThis horrifically traumatic experience gave the twins a deep enmity towards Tony Stark, and later, the Avengers, whom they aimed to take down. The Maximoffs dedicated much of their lives to this goal, including organizing protests against Stark Industries as well as the Avengers, whom they blamed for their parents\\' deaths. Their constant political activity put Wanda and Pietro on both S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA\\'s radar as potential threats and allies, respectively.[3]\\n\\nAvengers Conflict\\nJoining HYDRA\\n     Maximoff displaying her powers  \\n\\n\"Your reaction to the bombing of your civilian apartment building and the murder of your parents was to join an anti-freedom terrorist organization.\"\"We wanted to change the world.\"\\n―Agatha Harkness and Wanda Maximoff[src]\\nWhen the twins reached adulthood, Sokovia had become a war zone, with foreign forces led by the United States of America invading their streets frequently. Maximoff\\xa0and her brother took part in various riots to drive these foreigners out of their home. What the twins did not realize was that the riots were orchestrated by HYDRA, who had taken up residence in the country and were using its upheavals to cover up their experiments. During one such riot, the Maximoffs were amongst the protestors approached by List, who offered them a way to achieve the power needed to end war in Sokovia.\\n\\n     Maximoff in Wolfgang von Strucker\\'s base  \\nMaximoff was initially skeptical, but ultimately convinced by Pietro to agree to the experiments to gain new powers. Along with other volunteers from the town, Maximoff and Pietro underwent a series of tests conducted by List and Wolfgang von Strucker, where they were exposed to energy from the Scepter, which had fatal effects on all the other volunteers. The Maximoff twins, however, survived and experienced exceedingly different side-effects. The power of the scepter then unlocked latent supernatural powers within the pair; Pietro achieved superhuman speed, while Maximoff attained a number of mental/magic powers such as telekinesis, hypnosis, psionic energy projection, and reality warping after extracting the Mind Stone from the Scepter.[11][2]\\n\\nAttack on the Research Base\\n     The Maximoffs preparing to fight the Avengers  \\n\\n\"Let\\'s show them what we have accomplished. Send out the twins.\"\\n―List to Wolfgang von Strucker[src]\\nThe Avengers arrived in Sokovia and raided HYDRA Research Base, stealing the Scepter and arresting Wolfgang von Strucker. In the confusion, Maximoff twins escaped from their holding cells and, though inexperienced, were able to use their powers to evade the Avengers and escape. \\n\\n     Maximoff attacks Captain America  \\nWhile Pietro went outside and engaged Hawkeye, Maximoff stayed inside and defended Strucker. When Strucker became cornered by Captain America, he attempted to surrender. However, Maximoff snuck up behind Rogers and used her powers to throw him down the stairs. In the confusion, Maximoff escaped through a doorway. Rogers reported to the rest of the Avengers of the second enhanced individual on HYDRA\\'s side before knocking out Strucker and taking him into custody.\\n\\n     Maximoff uses her powers against Tony Stark  \\nMaximoff used her powers to briefly distract Tony Stark, tricking him into believing that a dead Leviathan specimen that Strucker had been studying was still alive, and showing him a dark vision where the Avengers were dead and the Chitauri invaded Earth from a Wormhole. Upon seeing Stark\\'s true fear of leading humanity down the path to global destruction, Maximoff allowed Stark and the Avengers to make off with the Scepter, despite Pietro\\'s protests, with hopes that Stark\\'s tampering with the alien weapon would lead to his own self-destruction.[3]\\n\\nJoining Ultron\\n     The Maximoffs hide out in Sokovia  \\n\\n\"You\\'re wondering why you can\\'t look inside my head.\"\"Sometimes it\\'s hard, but sooner or later every man shows himself.\"\\n―Ultron and Scarlet Witch[src]\\nWith the HYDRA Research Base and Wolfgang von Strucker captured, the Maximoffs returned to Sokovia, where Pietro provided for them by becoming a thief. One night, Maximoff found Pietro handing out items he had stolen, including an expensive Parisian dress to Zrinka. She mocked her brother\\'s attempts to flirt with all the women in Sokovia and warned him he would get shot if he kept stealing. As Pietro began to question Maximoff\\'s decision to let Tony Stark go free, Costel approached the pair and told them that \"Iron Man\" was waiting in a nearby church for them.[12]\\n\\n     The Maximoffs meet Ultron  \\nThe twins went to the church and found a mysterious man waiting for them wearing a red cloak who spoke about how much he enjoyed the church. When Maximoff grew wary and questioned why she could not read his mind, the man revealed himself to be Ultron, an A.I. accidentally created by Tony Stark who subsequently went rogue and began a murderous vendetta against the Avengers. Ultron then led the Maximoffs from the church and back to the HYDRA Research Base.\\n\\n     Maximoff is recruited by Ultron  \\nUltron revealed that he had taken over the base and was using it to create an army of Ultron Sentries. They discussed the reasons for killing the Avengers and Pietro told Ultron how they had lost their parents due to a Stark Industries missile; Maximoff noted that she and Pietro nearly died at Stark\\'s hand as well. Although they were initially unsure, Ultron assured the twins that they would use their powers to kill the Avengers, noting that while he and Pietro could hurt them, Maximoff would be able to tear them apart from the inside.[3]\\n\\nBattle at the Salvage Yard\\n     Maximoff threatening Ulysses Klaue\\'s mind  \\n\\n\"I’m going to kill him. I’ll be right back.\"\"No, I\\'m over it. I want... I want to finish the plan. I want the big one.\"\\n―Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch[src]\\nAgreeing to the alliance, Maximoff twins accompanied Ultron in acquiring Ulysses Klaue\\'s supply of vibranium. The Maximoffs entered the Salvage Yard first and shut off the lights before disarming Klaue and confronting him. Klaue remained unimpressed by the Maximoffs. Having heard of them already, he noted that he was saddened to hear of Wolfgang von Strucker\\'s death then mocked the pair for their reaction to learning of their mentor\\'s murder.\\n\\n     Maximoff subdues Ulysses Klaue\\'s henchman  \\nEventually, Klaue told the pair that he would have no respect for them if Maximoff used her powers to make him see what he feared, a cuttlefish, and he wished to speak to the man in charge. In response Ultron threw Klaue through a window and introduced himself. Ultron forced Klaue to sell him his stockpile of vibranium and paid him billions of dollars. However, when Klaue offended Ultron, the robot responded by cutting of Klaue\\'s arm and kicking him down some stairs while Maximoff used her powers to keep Klaue\\'s men from defending themselves.\\n\\n     Maximoff and Ultron fighting all the Avengers  \\nWhen the Avengers arrived in an attempt to stop them, Ultron and the Maximoffs mocked their efforts, ignoring Captain America\\'s attempts to convince the Maximoffs that they still had a chance to walk away. Ultron responded by attacking the team and the Maximoffs joined the fight. During the chaos of the battle, Maximoff managed to knock Captain America back with her powers and began \"hexing\" the minds of Thor, Black Widow, and Captain America. She attempted to enthrall Hawkeye but was subdued when he pushed a taser arrow onto her forehead.\\n\\n     Maximoff catches sight of Bruce Banner  \\nPietro saved her in the nick of time, throwing Hawkeye through a window and taking her outside Klaue\\'s base to recover. Although she suffered great pain from the taser arrow, Maximoff wished to complete their plan. She caught sight of Bruce Banner and managed to \"hex\" him as well, forcing him to transform into the Hulk and go on a rampage through Johannesburg, resulting in Iron Man being forced to battle his friend. In the confusion, the twins managed to escape with Ultron and the vibranium, and made their way to Seoul.[3]\\n\\nUltron\\'s Intentions Revealed\\n     Maximoff learns of Ultron\\'s true intentions  \\n\\n\"You said we would destroy the Avengers. Make a better world.\"\"It will be better.\"\"When everyone is dead?\"\\n―Scarlet Witch and Ultron[src]\\nWhen the trio arrived in Seoul, Ultron used the Scepter to indoctrinate Helen Cho, forcing her to use the vibranium in synchrony with the Regeneration Cradle to build a new, more powerful body for Ultron. As Ultron\\'s consciousness was being uploaded into the body, Maximoff curiously took the opportunity to explore Ultron\\'s mind and was horrified to learn of Ultron\\'s true plans, which involved the genocide of humanity in its entirety. Maximoff freed Cho from the mind control to halt the creation of Ultron\\'s body. With Pietro, she then abandoned Ultron and fled the facility, much to the automaton\\'s rage.[3]\\n\\nBattle of Seoul\\n     The Maximoffs decide to assist the Avengers  \\n\\n\"Please, don\\'t do this.\"\"What choice do we have?\"\\n―Ultron and Scarlet Witch[src]\\nThe twins attempted to escape Seoul, but as they made their way through the city, they spotted a news report showing that the Avengers were battling Ultron and his army in the middle of the city, endangering thousands of lives. Refusing to allow the people of Seoul to be put in danger, the Maximoffs decided to join the Avengers.\\n\\n     Maximoff saves Captain America from Ultron  \\nThey eventually caught up and assisted Captain America in fighting off Ultron on a moving passenger train. Maximoff used her powers to put a defensive barrier between Ultron and Rogers by twisting the metal bars inside the train while Pietro knocked him down. Upon seeing that he was betrayed and outnumbered by his former teammates, Ultron responded by destroying the controls of the train before flying out the side door and escaping, leaving the Maximoffs and Rogers on the train going full speed as it headed to the end of the tracks.\\n\\n     Maximoff using her abilities to stop the train  \\nWith the train now completely out of control and heading to the middle of the city, Rogers ordered Maximoff to stop it, while Pietro moved any civilians out of its path. Mustering up all of her power and strength, Maximoff lifted the train\\'s wheels off the ground and applied the breaks as hard as she could. Although the train was slowing down, it still crashed through buildings. Pietro was able to save the lives of the people in the way until the train was finally stopped in its tracks.\\n\\n     Maximoff warns Steve Rogers of Tony Stark  \\nWith the train now stopped, Maximoff ran to her brother\\'s aid, as he could barely stand after running so fast for so long. When Rogers revealed that the Regeneration Cradle and Ultron\\'s would-be body had been sent to Tony Stark for analysis, Maximoff was disturbed, aware that Stark would attempt to utilize the body rather than destroy it in order to correct his own folly. Although Rogers was reluctant to accept this as a possibility, noting that Stark was not crazy, Maximoff compared Stark and Ultron and made key comparisons with their mindsets.[3]\\n\\nChanging Sides\\nThe Birth of Vision\\n     Maximoff prepares to attack Tony Stark  \\n\\n\"I looked in your head and saw annihilation.\"\"Look again.\"\\n―Wanda Maximoff and Vision[src]\\nThe Maximoff twins then accompanied Captain America back to the Avengers Tower and found Maximoff\\'s fear to be accurate; Tony Stark and Bruce Banner were trying to upload the consciousness of J.A.R.V.I.S. into the body. After a brief scuffle, Wanda was held back by Banner but she managed to escape his hold, only to witness Thor bringing the body to life.\\n\\n     Maximoff speaks to Vision  \\nShe watched in fear as the being initially attacked Thor before looking over New York City and calming down. The being introduced himself to them, calling itself Vision. The Maximoffs and the Avengers continued to be wary of Vision, with Scarlet Witch noting that she had seen the destruction of the world in its head. Eventually, Vision convinced the team that he was on their side and proved his worthiness by picking up Mjølnir and handing it to Thor.\\n\\n     Maximoff joins the Avengers  \\nShe and Pietro then agreed to join the Avengers stopping Ultron and saving Sokovia, where he would be enacting his final plan. The Maximoffs took new uniforms and joined the Avengers on the Quinjet as Rogers gave a speech where he informed the team that their priority was getting the innocent people of Sokovia out of harm\\'s way before Ultron could destroy their homes and lives. Wishing to save the lives of her friends from her home city, Maximoff sided with her former enemies, although she was unsure of trusting the Avengers in the long term.[3]\\n\\nBattle of Sokovia\\n     Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver in Sokovia  \\n\\n\"Get off the bridge! Run!\"\\n―Scarlet Witch to the people of Sokovia[src]\\nUpon arriving in Sokovia, Scarlet Witch played a significant part in evacuating civilians from Novi Grad, using her powers of mind control on dozens of innocents and leading them safely from the war zone. When the army of Ultron Sentries began their attack, Maximoff took up a defensive position on a bridge, shielding innocent civilians from enemy fire with her powers as they ran to safety, however, the firepower of the Sentries proved too strong and knocked her back.\\n\\n     Scarlet Witch watches Novi Grad rising  \\nEventually, Ultron, using a device forged from the remaining vibranium samples, forced a large part of the city of Novi Grad to levitate so that once it reached a certain height, it would cause an extinction level event once it made an impact with the Earth. As Ultron gave a speech to the people of Sokovia while flying outside the city, Scarlet Witch and the rest of the Avengers could only look on in horror as Ultron unleashed his seemingly unstoppable plan.[3]\\n\\nRescued by Hawkeye\\n     Scarlet Witch listens to Hawkeye\\'s speech  \\n\\n\"How could I let this happen?\"\"Hey, hey, you okay?\"\"This is all our fault.\"\"Hey, look at me. It\\'s your fault, it\\'s everyone\\'s fault, who cares. Are you up for this?\"\\n―Scarlet Witch and Hawkeye[src]\\nThis, along with the carnage that was falling upon the city, overwhelmed Maximoff. Hawkeye managed to lead her into a vacant building for safety from the Ultron Sentries.\\xa0Maximoff struggled\\xa0with terror and guilt over causing such a disaster in her own home, perceiving it as being her fault and beginning to lose morale.\\n\\n     Scarlet Witch is inspired by Hawkeye\\'s words  \\nHowever, Barton brushed aside Maximoff\\'s guilt for the time being and simply responded that she needed to make a choice:\\xa0either\\xa0stay hidden and wait for her brother to take her somewhere safe or continue the battle. Barton assured Maximoff that if she continued to fight to the end with them, then her past wouldn\\'t matter because she would become an Avenger. As Barton then went back outside to battle Ultron, Maximoff was left to think over what he told her.[3]\\n\\nBecoming an Avenger\\n     Scarlet Witch fights back against Ultron  \\n\\n\"It doesn\\'t matter what you did, or what you were. If you go out there, you fight, and you fight to kill. Stay in here, you\\'re good. I\\'ll send your brother to come find you. But if you step out that door... you are an Avenger.\"\\n―Hawkeye to Scarlet Witch[src]\\nHer confidence restored by Clint Barton\\'s words, Maximoff stepped outside and saved the overwhelmed Hawkeye from a small squad of Ultron Sentries, using her powers to pull them apart and throw them across Novi Grad.\\n\\n     Scarlet Witch and Hawkeye clear the Sentries  \\nOnce the Sentries were destroyed, the pair reported to Captain America and prepared for their next mission. As they began to walk through the city, Quicksilver ran in and picked up his sister, running across the city with her while leaving Barton to jog behind.\\n\\n     The Maximoffs fight against Ultron\\'s army  \\nScarlet Witch and Quicksilver ran into the middle of the city and teamed up to assist in the battle by protecting civilians still trapped in the city, running ahead of Sokovian Police Department officers who were pinned down by the Ultron Sentries. While Scarlet Witch fired energy blasts at the robots, Quicksilver ran into the battle but was accidentally grazed in the arm by a police officer despite the chief calling for the police to stop firing.[3]\\n\\n     Scarlet Witch discusses the plan  \\nRogers informed the Avengers that they are leading the civilians to the town hall. He met up with Maximoff and Black Widow, who asked why Maximoff was wearing her jacket. Rogers told her that Maximoff was with them now. Barton then caught up with them and warned that if they got any higher, people would start dropping. Rogers ordered Scarlet Witch to get the civilians out from hiding, and for Barton to watch her back.[12]\\n\\n     Scarlet Witch evacuates the people of Sokovia  \\nSoon after, a Helicarrier commanded by Nick Fury and Maria Hill came to the Avengers\\' aide, sending out Lifeboats to evacuate the civilians still trapped at the city. Once the transports landed, Maximoff assisted in escorting civilians to the Lifeboats that ferried them aboard the flying aircraft carrier, keeping the women and children back until it was safe and ushering them on board alongside Barton. Meanwhile, Fury sent War Machine to protect the Lifeboats from any Sentries attacking them mid-air.[3]\\n\\nProtecting the Key\\n     The Maximoffs challenge Ultron  \\n\\n\"Get the people on the boats.\"\"I’m not going to leave you here.\"\"I can handle these. Come back for me when everyone else is off.\"\\n―Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver[src]\\nMaximoff, Quicksilver and the rest of the Avengers regrouped at the church in the center of Novi Grad where Ultron had set up the key to the device that would cause the city to drop. Captain America explained that Ultron must not be allowed to activate the key as it would destroy the city and the planet. As they stood around the key, Ultron hovered outside the church. When Thor challenged him, Ultron showed off his army of hundreds of Ultron Sentries.\\n\\n     Scarlet Witch fights the Ultron Sentries  \\nWhen Ultron unleashed his army upon them, Scarlet Witch and the Avengers put all their might into battling the seemingly endless horde of Ultron Sentries, with Maximoff using her gifts to pull them out of the air and rip them apart from the inside. Eventually the team managed to wipe out the majority of Ultron\\'s drones and Ultron himself was almost destroyed by the combined might of Vision, Thor, Iron Man, and the Hulk, who destroyed his armor and sent him across the city.\\n\\n     Scarlet Witch agrees to protect the key  \\nWith the battle almost won, Captain America ordered the team to evacuate the city before Iron Man and Thor destroyed the key and Novi Grad itself. As the key needed to be guarded against Ultron in the meantime, Scarlet Witch volunteered to stay behind, telling Hawkeye that it was her job to protect it. The team agreed but Quicksilver insisted that he would not leave her behind, but she ordered him to continue getting the people to the boats and only come back for her at the last minute, insisting she could handle the responsibility.[3]\\n\\nQuicksilver\\'s Sacrifice\\n     Scarlet Witch senses Quicksilver\\'s death  \\n\\n\"Wanda, if you stay here, you\\'ll die.\"\"I just did. Do you know how it felt? It felt like that...\"\\n―Ultron and Scarlet Witch[src]\\nWhile keeping the Ultron Sentries away from the key, Scarlet Witch sensed a terrible thing, as her brother attempted to save Hawkeye and a young boy from Ultron, who had obtained a Quinjet, he was shot and killed by the robot. Sensing this, Maximoff dropped to her knees and cried out in pure anguish, obliterating the sentries she had been fighting with a single massive blast of energy.\\n\\n     Scarlet Witch gets her revenge on Ultron  \\nOvercome with rage and emotion, Maximoff left her post to avenge her brother, tracking down Ultron, who had been ripped out of the Quinjet by the Hulk and had crash-landed inside a bus. Maximoff knelt beside her former ally, who pleaded with her to escape before she was killed in the approaching explosion, Maximoff told the robot that she had already died due to heartbreak and to demonstrate this, she telekinetically ripped his core processor from his body.\\n\\n     Scarlet Witch is saved by Vision  \\nHer action inadvertently allowed a single Ultron drone to activate the device, sending Novi Grad plummeting towards Earth with her still trapped inside. Maximoff accepted her fate as she plummeted towards the ground, being the only person left in the city; however, she was rescued at the last minute by Vision. Seconds after their escape, Iron Man and Thor averted the cataclysm by combining their abilities to vaporize the city, saving billions of lives.[3]\\n\\nNew Avengers\\nMoving to the United States\\n     Scarlet Witch arriving at the Avengers Facility  \\n\\n\"Pietro was dead and I was in a new country. I was all alone.\"\\n―Wanda Maximoff to Agatha Harkness[src]\\nThe ordeal with Ultron having finally passed, Maximoff was recruited into the Avengers\\' roster along with James Rhodes, Vision and Sam Wilson as a permanent member of the team. Maximoff was also provided with a new uniform to wear as an Avenger.\\n\\n     Scarlet Witch officially joins the Avengers  \\nThey arrived at the New Avengers Facility and began their training under the leadership of Captain America and Black Widow.[3] HYDRA collected many of the parts of the destroyed Ultron Sentries and took them to an undisclosed location in Eastern Europe, where they used the parts to create a giant robot called Ultimo. HYDRA then used the Ultimo to attack a small village. Maximoff joined the Avengers in an attack on the giant robot and together they managed to destroy Ultimo.[13]\\n\\nBonding with Vision\\n     Maximoff watching sitcoms to comfort her  \\n\\n\"The only thing that would bring me comfort is seeing him again.

It\\'s just gonna drown me.\"\\n―Wanda Maximoff to Vision[src]\\nStill grieving the loss of her brother, Maximoff, who was all alone in a new place, would watch sitcoms in her bedroom to comfort herself. When she sensed Vision on the other side of the wall, he entered, apologizing for intruding, but she asked him to sit next to her and watch TV.\\n\\n     Maximoff and Vision starting to fall in love  \\nAs they watched the TV, Vision expressed a desire to learn about Maximoff\\'s sadness, if that would bring her comfort, but she didn\\'t think it would, only wanting her brother back. However, Maximoff decided to open up to Vision, explaining the overwhelming sorrow she was feeling, but he believed that it wouldn\\'t always be that way, and that he saw it as love persevering, despite his lack of experiencing loss, noting he has never had a loved one. This cheered Maximoff up, and caused her to develop strong feelings for Vision, as they continued to watch TV, enjoying it together.[1]\\n\\nLagos Catastrophe\\n     Scarlet Witch undercover at a café  \\n\\n\"Wanda. Just like we practiced.\"\"What about the gas?\"\"Get it out.\"\\n―Captain America and Scarlet Witch[src]\\nApproximately a year after the Ultron Offensive, Scarlet Witch joined her fellow Avengers in tracking down Crossbones and his mercenaries to Lagos, Nigeria. Scarlet Witch positioned herself at a café, where she described the police station in the area, trying to uncover Crossbones\\' plan as part of her training from Black Widow, who was teaching her spy techniques.\\n\\n     Scarlet Witch battles all Crossbones\\' soldiers  \\nThey soon learned that Crossbones was planning to instead attack the Institute for Infectious Diseases and steal a biochemical weapon. Captain America then ordered them to make their way to the IFID to stop the attack. The Avengers immediately rushed towards the IFID, with Captain America arriving first on the scene, followed by Falcon and Scarlet Witch, and took out the outside mercenaries. Scarlet Witch lifted Captain America onto the third floor to subdue Crossbones and used her powers to vent the anaesthetic gas out into the open air.\\n\\n     Scarlet Witch clears the gas from the building  \\nFalcon and Black Widow managed to neutralize the mercenaries and secure the biochemical weapon that Crossbones had obtained while they tried to escape through a busy marketplace. Captain America and Crossbones fought intensely before Captain America managed to disarm and subdue Crossbones. Crossbones taunted Captain America and claimed that the Winter Soldier had hired him to steal the biochemical weapon, once again under HYDRA\\'s mind control.\\n\\n     Scarlet Witch accidentally blows up a building  \\nScarlet Witch arrived at the scene when suddenly, Crossbones pulled the cord on his suicide vest in an effort to kill both him and Captain America. She managed to temporarily contain the explosion around Crossbones and tried to move its impact away by propelling him into the air. However, Scarlet Witch inadvertently destroyed a nearby building with the blast, killing many of its occupants, much to her horror.[4] As she teared up in the streets, Black Widow arrived to comfort her.[14]\\n\\nFeeling the Guilt\\n     Maximoff watching the news report about her  \\n\\n\"It\\'s my fault.\"\"That\\'s not true.\"\"Turn the TV back on.

She watched a news report on the aftermath of the attack in Lagos questioning her ability to even operate in Nigeria.\\n\\n     Maximoff is comforted by Steve Rogers  \\nSteve Rogers tried to assure the young woman that it was not her fault, saying he should have taken apart Crossbones\\' suicide vest before it went off. Not totally convinced, Maximoff stated they were both at fault then, to which Rogers reminded her that despite the casualties, they were able to stop Crossbones from killing more. The two were interrupted by Vision, whom Maximoff scolded for once again phasing through the wall to get into her room instead of using the door. Vision apologized and informed Rogers that Tony Stark had arrived with Thaddeus Ross at the Facility.[4]\\n\\nAvengers Civil War\\nSokovia Accords\\n     Maximoff learns of the Sokovia Accords  \\n\\n\"You\\'re saying they\\'ll come for me?\"\"We would protect you.\"\\n―Wanda Maximoff and Vision[src]\\nMaximoff, along with the rest of the Avengers, met up with Thaddeus Ross and Tony Stark who introduced them to the Sokovia Accords, a set of internationally ratified legal documents that provides regulation and a framework for the military/law enforcement deployment of enhanced individuals which included Maximoff.\\n\\n     Maximoff is shown footage of the recent fight  \\nRoss showed footage from battles that the Avengers fought in, showing the destruction and death that followed.

When she brought up the fact that she would be hunted if they didn\\'t sign, Vision assured her that they would protect her.\\n\\n     Maximoff displays her abilities towards Vision  \\nWhile the other Avengers left to deal with Winter Soldier and attend the meeting in Vienna, Maximoff stayed at the facility under the watch of Vision. Vision tried to cook her something to lift her spirits, though his inexperience with food left it wanting. The two Avengers had a heart-to-heart about their powers and how they are feared by others, but when Maximoff tried to leave the facility, Vision stopped her, telling her that Stark had asked him to ensure she did not leave the compound until the debate with the Accords were over.[4]\\n\\nRescued by Hawkeye\\n     Maximoff and Hawkeye are stopped by Vision  \\n\\n\"Clint, you can\\'t overpower me.\"\"I know I can\\'t... but she can.\"\"Vision, that\\'s enough.

Barton created an explosion outside to distract Vision. As Maximoff watched Vision, she sensed a presence behind her and launched a knife at the intruder, stopping her attack when she realized it was Barton. Barton told her that they need to go as Captain America needed their help to fight against the Sokovia Accords; as they were leaving, Vision returned and stopped them.\\n\\n     Scarlet Witch is forced to subdue Vision  \\nApproaching the two, the trap that Barton had set up went off, paralyzing Vision with electricity.

So, Hawkeye confirmed that only Captain America and Winter Soldier could get to Siberia while the rest of the team stayed behind. To distract Iron Man\\'s team, Ant-Man transformed into \"Giant-Man,\" focusing the opposition on defeating him rather than stopping Captain America and Winter Soldier from reaching the Quinjet.\\n\\n     Scarlet Witch being attacked by War Machine  \\nHowever, War Machine managed to evade Giant-Man and pursued the two until Scarlet Witch started hurling large objects at him, keeping him from reaching the hangar. Vision destroyed a traffic control tower so Captain America and Winter Soldier couldn\\'t escape but Scarlet Witch used her powers to hold back the debris for them to pass. Seeing this, War Machine used a Stark Sonic Cannon to knock her out, causing the tower to fall.\\n\\n     Vision comforting Scarlet Witch  \\nAfter the battle, Vision went to check on Scarlet Witch, and they apologized to each other. As Vision comforted Scarlet Witch, War Machine requested Vision\\'s back up in disabling Falcon\\'s wing thrusters. Distracted, Vision accidentally grazed War Machine\\'s arc reactor, disabling the suit and causing him to fall from the sky--paralyzing him upon impact, therefore letting Captain America and Winter Soldier fly away to Siberia.[4]\\n\\nImprisoned in the Raft\\n     Tony Stark watches Scarlet Witch in her cell  \\n\\n\"Criminals? Criminals, Tony. Think that\\'s the word you\\'re looking for. Right? That didn\\'t used to mean me. Or Sam, or Wanda. But here we are.\"\\n―Clint Barton to Tony Stark[src]\\nAfter their defeat, Maximoff, Clint Barton, Sam Wilson and Scott Lang were arrested and imprisoned in the Raft, where she was the only one outfitted with a shock collar and put in a strait-jacket to prevent her using her powers. Tony Stark visited the prison to find out where Captain America went and was disturbed to see Maximoff\\'s condition.\\n\\n     Maximoff imprisoned in the Raft  \\nRogers eventually infiltrated the Raft and freed Maximoff, Barton, Wilson and Lang from their cells. Despite being wanted fugitives, Rogers told Stark that should he ever need their help, all he would have to do is ask.[4] Following her liberation, Maximoff would occasionally depart from the fugitive Avengers to Scotland, where she would frequently meet up with Vision, who would take a human form and turn off any trackers, so the two could be with each other.[15][5]\\n\\nInfinity War\\nAttack on Vision\\n     Maximoff and Vision spend time together  \\n\\n\"We have to go.\"\"Please leave.\"\"You asked me to stay. I\\'m staying.\"\\n―Wanda Maximoff and Vision[src]\\nOne night, Vision began to feel an alert from the Mind Stone in his forehead, so he asked Maximoff to use her powers to feel it. She claimed that all she felt was him and the two embraced each other. They then went outside where Maximoff informed Vision of train times so that he could return to the Avengers Compound. Vision began suggesting that they form their own life together, which she was unsure about due to the promises they had made to their respective teams.\\n\\n     Maximoff battling Proxima Midnight  \\nBefore she can give her official answer, she then noticed a SBN news report about an alien attack in New York City and Tony Stark being missing. Vision prepared to leave, intending to join the fight, but Maximoff was reluctant to let him leave because she knew his life would be put at significant risk. Moments before he was about to reply to her, Vision was attacked by Corvus Glaive and Maximoff was thrown away by an energy blast from Proxima Midnight before she could strike back at Glaive.\\n\\n     Maximoff attempts to protect Vision  \\nThey then began to forcefully remove the stone from Vision\\'s forehead, but Maximoff was able to fight them off. Maximoff attempted to escape with Vision and temporarily hid from Midnight and Glaive before they were found. Maximoff faced Midnight and barely managed to hold her own while Vision unsuccessfully fought Glaive on top of a church. When Vision again became subdued, Maximoff rescued him from Glaive and attempted to escape with Vision again by flight, but the two were blasted out of the air by Proxima Midnight and cornered in an empty train station.\\n\\n     Maximoff notices Steve Rogers\\' arrival  \\nMaximoff prepared to be the final line of defense for Vision, until Steve Rogers arrived along with Black Widow and Falcon, who, with relative ease, managed to defeat the Black Order, but they escaped before they could be captured or killed by the reunited Avengers. The group decided that they had to return to the Avengers Compound in hopes of developing a plan to help Vision and gaining more information about their extraterrestrial attackers.[5]\\n\\nTrying to Save Vision\\n     Maximoff returns to the New Avengers Facility  \\n\\n\"I think if it were exposed to a sufficiently powerful energy source, something very similar to its own signature, perhaps its molecular integrity will fail.\"\"Yeah, and you with it. I\\'m not having this conversation.\"\\n―Vision and Scarlet Witch[src]\\nFollowing the battle at Scotland, Maximoff, Steve Rogers, Vision, Black Widow, and Falcon arrived at the New Avengers Facility. There they reunited with James Rhodes, who rebelled against Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross, and Bruce Banner, who had returned to Earth. They then discussed Thanos\\' mission and how he is trying to steal the Mind Stone from Vision. Vision came to the conclusion that the only way to make sure that wouldn\\'t happen is if the stone was destroyed by Maximoff.\\n\\n     Maximoff disagrees with Vision\\'s proposal  \\nHowever, she rejected this idea, knowing it would kill him in the process. Despite Vision\\'s persistence, Bruce Banner produced an alternative idea that entailed removing the stone, keeping Vision alive through the other components of his creation. However, this could not be done by Banner, so Rogers suggested that they go to Wakanda.\\n\\n     Maximoff listening to Shuri  \\nThe group traveled to Wakanda seeking the aid of Shuri, the sister of T\\'Challa. As Vision was scanned by Shuri, Maximoff asked if she would be able to remove the stone. She told her that she could, but it would be difficult due to the two trillions neurones that needed to be dealt with carefully.\\n\\n     Maximoff contemplates joining in the battle  \\nSuddenly, a swarm of Outrider Dropships landed outside the dome, causing everyone to go outside to defend Vision. Rogers ordered Maximoff to destroy the stone as soon as it was removed from Vision. Maximoff stood by Vision as he underwent the removal of the stone; however, she noticed the battle occurring outside, witnessing the arrival of Threshers, causing her to realize she had to be out there.[5]\\n\\nBattle of Wakanda\\n     Scarlet Witch joining the battle in Wakanda  \\n\\n\"Why was she up there all this time?\"\\n―Okoye[src]\\nScarlet Witch then left the room and made her way to the battlefield, where she saved Black Widow and Okoye by stopping the incoming Threshers and threw them on top of the Outriders. However, her presence of the battlefield allowed Proxima Midnight to notify Corvus Glaive that Vision was left unguarded by her. When Falcon pointed out Vision being in danger, Scarlet Witch went to help him, but was struck in the head by Midnight, causing her to fall into a ditch.\\n\\n     Scarlet Witch lifts and kills Proxima Midnight  \\nMidnight then taunted Scarlet Witch as she prepared to kill her, but was stopped when Black Widow and Okoye intervened. The two fought off the alien, as Scarlet Witch recovered from the powerful blow she received. As the fight continued, the two found themselves overwhelmed by Midnight, who came close to killing Black Widow. However, Scarlet Witch was able to step in and use her powers to stop Midnight by launching her into an incoming Thresher, ultimately killing her. Following this, she quickly returned to Vision\\'s side to protect him.[5]\\n\\nThanos\\' Victory\\n     Scarlet Witch being told to destroy the stone  \\n\\n\"I understand, my child, better than anyone.\"\"You could never.\"\\n―Thanos and Scarlet Witch[src]\\nVision then sensed Thanos\\' arrival, causing everyone to be prepared, as they witnessed him appear through a portal. Scarlet Witch was about to join the fight, but Vision told her that she had to destroy the stone. She continued to refuse to do so, but he begged her to, knowing it was the only way to thwart Thanos\\' plans. Vision then comforted her as she understood what had to be done, still greatly upset about doing it. He reassured her, stating that she could never hurt him and repeating her earlier words, \"I just feel you.\"\\n\\n     Scarlet Witch keeping Thanos away  \\nIn tears, Scarlet Witch reluctantly unleashed a stream of psionic energy into the Stone while the other Avengers made futile attempts to stop Thanos. After easily defeating the Avengers, Thanos began to approach Scarlet Witch and Vision. She then struck him with a separate stream of energy to stall him further, slowing him down significantly, before managing to destroy the Stone just as he was about to reach them. The Mind Stone shattered, releasing a huge blast of energy that knocked Scarlet Witch to the ground and destroyed Vision\\'s body.\\n\\n     Scarlet Witch watches the restoration of Vision  \\nAs she laid on the ground, heartbroken, Thanos empathized with her pain, understanding the sacrifice of what she most loved. She bitterly stated that he knew nothing. She then watched in horror as Thanos used the Time Stone to restore Vision with the clear intent to rip the Mind Stone from his head. Scarlet Witch attempted to stop him, but Thanos swatted her aside with little effort and ripped the Stone from Vision\\'s head, killing him a second time. Now equipped with the final Mind Stone, the Infinity Gauntlet was complete.\\n\\n     Scarlet Witch being turned into dust  \\nWith Thanos finally succeeding in his plan of collecting all of the Infinity Stones, he unleashed the full extent of his new power. With a mere snap of his fingers, Thanos began to exterminate half of all lives in the universe in random succession. As a countless number of beings began to fade from existence, Scarlet Witch knelt over Vision\\'s lifeless body in mourning before joining the multitudes of lost souls in being disintegrated.[5]\\n\\nBattle of Earth\\n     Scarlet Witch rejoins the fight against Thanos  \\n\\n\"You took everything from me.\"\"I don\\'t even know who you are.\"\"You will.\"\\n―Scarlet Witch and Thanos[src]\\nAt a point in 2023, the surviving Avengers had successfully retrieved all six Infinity Stones through Time Travel, thus enabling them to reverse the Snap. Scarlet Witch, along with many other heroes, joined the Avengers in the battle against Thanos and his army by means of teleportation by the Masters of the Mystic Arts.\\n\\n     Scarlet Witch fights alongside the Avengers  \\nScarlet Witch arrived at the ruins of the Avengers Compound alongside Valkyrie, Korg, Miek and the rest of the Asgardians and Einherjar. With all heroes united, and armies rallied, Captain America then led the ensuing charge against Thanos\\' army. Scarlet Witch used her powers to blast airborne enemies with large bolts of her psionic energy.\\n\\n     Scarlet Witch battles Thanos  \\nIn the thick of the battle, an enraged Scarlet Witch, with the recollection of Vision\\'s death still fresh in her memory, faced the Mad Titan herself and blamed him for his death. Being an alternate version of his prime counterpart from 2014, Thanos retorted that he did not know who she was. In response, she taunted him that he would as she rapidly overwhelmed him by hurling enormous piles of debris and powerful blasts of energy. After breaking his double-edged sword in half, Scarlet Witch suspended Thanos in the air, peeling off his armor and slowly tearing him apart.\\n\\n     Scarlet Witch helps Captain Marvel  \\nTo save himself from her wrath, he was forced to call in an air strike. Scarlet Witch then tried to shield herself, only to be knocked back by the blasts, sustaining only concussive force. Relief came in the form of Captain Marvel, who destroyed the Sanctuary II with ease. As Captain Marvel collected the Nano Gauntlet from Spider-Man, Scarlet Witch joined her, alongside other female heroes, in breaching through the enemy lines to reach Luis\\' van\\xa0and\\xa0return the stones to their rightful places in time. She cleared a path through a horde of Outriders and single-handedly held back a Leviathan.\\n\\n     Scarlet Witch kneels before Iron Man  \\nScarlet Witch continued to take out Thanos\\' army, using her powers while in flight, mainly defeating the bigger and stronger opponents. After an intense battle, Thanos and his entire army were defeated when Iron Man wielded the stones and snapped the forces out of existence, resulting in his own life being taken. Everyone gathered around the fallen hero and kneeled before him, showing their respect.[16]\\n\\nRemembering the Fallen\\n     Maximoff attends Tony Stark\\'s funeral  \\n\\n\"You know, I wish there was a way... that I could let her know... that we won. We did it.\"\"She knows.

She stood with Bucky Barnes and Sam Wilson as the funeral proceeded, where they watched Pepper Potts and Morgan Stark, place Tony\\'s Arc Reactor into the river and watched it float away. \\n\\n     Maximoff and Clint Barton comfort each other  \\nAfter the funeral, Maximoff reunited with Clint Barton, who stood by her in silence, thinking of those they had lost. The two stood by a lake, and Barton expressed his desire for Natasha Romanoff, who had also died to obtain the Soul Stone, to know that they were successful. Maximoff assured him that Romanoff did know, as well as Vision, too. Having both recently lost people close to them, Maximoff and Barton both comforted each other.[16]\\n\\nWandaVision\\nWanting Vision Back\\n     Maximoff arrives to recover Vision\\'s body  \\n\\n\"I can\\'t feel you.\"\\n―Wanda Maximoff to Vision[src]\\nThree weeks after the Battle of Earth, Maximoff, wanting to have a funeral for Vision, tracked his body to S.W.O.R.D. headquarters, as they collected him from Wakanda after the Snap. Maximoff pled that they return Vision to her, so they directed her to Tyler Hayward\\'s office.\\n\\n     Maximoff says her final goodbye to Vision  \\nHayward addressed Maximoff\\'s intention to recover Vision\\'s body, so he showed her to where they were dismantling him, much to Maximoff\\'s horror. Explaining to Hayward that Vision was not a weapon, Maximoff once more asked to take his body so she could bury him, but Hayward refused, suspecting that she may want to resurrect him. Maximoff stated that she couldn\\'t do that, nor was that her intention, but Hayward still refused. Maximoff solemnly said her goodbye to Vision, discovering that she could no longer feel him, and left the facility.\\n\\n     Maximoff creates an illusion of Vision  \\nDefeated, Maximoff drove out to Westview, New Jersey, where Vision had purchased a lot for them to build a house and live together. Arriving at the land, Maximoff, overcome by severe anguish, had a breakdown, causing her to unleash her power to form a new reality around her, building a house, and then the entire town of Westview, depicting it to be the 1950s sitcom. Maximoff finished by conjuring an illusion of Vision, and proceeded to engulf herself in the new reality where she and Vision were together.[1]\\n\\nLiving in Suburbia\\n     Maximoff and Vision drive through Westview  \\n\\n\"We are an unusual couple, you know?\"\"Oh, I don\\'t think that was ever in question.\"\\n―Wanda Maximoff and Vision[src]\\nNow living in a reality of her own control, including all the inhabitants and storylines, Maximoff and the Vision she created became newlyweds who had just moved into town, attempting to blend in and live normal lives, despite Maximoff\\'s telekinetic abilities and Vision being an android.\\n\\n     Maximoff is welcomed by Agnes  \\nOne day, the two noticed a heart drawn on their calendar, but neither knew what the occasion was. When Vision left to go to work, Maximoff was visited by Agnes, who welcomed her to the neighborhood. Maximoff believed that it was her and Vision\\'s anniversary, so Agnes helped her prepare for the special night. Vision called Maximoff about the day\\'s occasion, with the latter thinking it was their anniversary, and the former knowing it was a dinner with his boss and his wife. Maximoff, having the wrong idea, told Vision she had everything under control.\\n\\n     Maximoff uses her powers to make dinner  \\nThat night, when Vision came home with their dinner guests, Maximoff, wearing a night gown came down to surprise him, only to be shocked when she learned the true nature of the night. After changing her clothes, Maximoff was then forced to prepare a home cooked meal for the Harts, while also trying to hide her powers as she did. As Vision keep the Harts entertained, Maximoff struggled to cook dinner, so Vision checked in on her, and they switched roles, with Maximoff distracting the Harts. Despite the hijinks, Maximoff was able to make dinner, and the four sat down to eat.\\n\\n     Maximoff and Vision reaffirm their love  \\nMs. Hart asked Maximoff and Vision about their story, entailing where they moved from and how long they\\'ve been married, but neither of them were able to answer any of her questions. This led to Mr. Hart growing angry at the couple for not having an answer, until he begun chocking on his food. This caused the reality to break, so Maximoff told Vision to help Mr. Hart, and everything went back to normal. After the Harts left, Maximoff and Vision reflected on the dinner, and decided to make it the day of their anniversary, with Maximoff making them wedding rings.[6]\\n\\nThe Magic Show\\n     Maximoff is awoken in the night by noises  \\n\\n\"A magician never reveals his secrets. He leaves that to his assistant.\"\"And she\\'s not talking.\"\\n―Vision and Wanda Maximoff[src]\\nTransitioning into the 1960s, Maximoff and Vision were awoken in the night by strange noises, which turned out to just be the trees hitting the window. Because Maximoff altered their beds to now be joined together, she and Vision took the opportunity to make love.\\n\\n     Maximoff discovers an in color toy helicopter  \\nThe next day, Maximoff and Vision practised their magic act for the neighborhood talent show, in which Vision was the magician, \"Illusion,\" and Maximoff was his assistant, \"Glamour.\" Later, Maximoff discovered a toy helicopter in color with a sword symbol outside her house, to her confusion, but was interrupted by Agnes, and the two headed to the planning committee meeting, hosted by Dottie Jones. At the meeting, Maximoff, who was having trouble fitting in with the other women, met and befriended Geraldine, as they continue to listen to Jones.\\n\\n     Maximoff hears a voice speak to her  \\nAfter the meeting, Jones had Maximoff clean up, while also revealing that she has heard things about Maximoff and Vision. Maximoff tried to assure Jones that she didn\\'t intend anyone harm, but Jones didn\\'t believe her. Suddenly, a voice came through the radio, speaking directly to Maximoff, but it was soon stopped. This added to Maximoff\\'s worries, but she carried on as normal. At the time of the talent show, Maximoff got dressed into her costume, and nervously waited for Vision to arrive.\\n\\n     Maximoff and Vision doing a magic show  \\nEventually, a malfunctioning Vision arrived, and Maximoff attempted to tell him about the strange occurrences she experienced, but they were brought on stage to begin their act. Despite Maximoff following the routine, Vision\\'s state caused him to use his powers in front of the audience, which Maximoff had to cover up using her own powers, including making Geraldine appear in the Cabinet of Mysteries. After the show, Maximoff fixed Vision by removing the piece of gum inside him, and they returned home, being awarded Comedy Performance of the Year.[7]\\n\\nSudden Pregnancy\\n     Maximoff suddenly becomes pregnant  \\n\\n\"With all the close calls we’ve been having, it seems the people of Westview are always on the verge of discovering our secret.\"\"Yes, I know what you mean.

I think something\\'s wrong here, Wanda.\"\\n―Wanda Maximoff and Vision[src]\\nMaximoff and Vision reflected on their day, feeling that they fitted in with the town. Then, inexplicably, Maximoff became pregnant, much to their surprise and delight. They were interrupted by a noise outside, which was a beekeeper climbing out of the sewers, causing Maximoff to rewind reality so it would not be disrupted, as well as transitioning them into a color-filled 1970s.[7]\\n\\n     Maximoff being checked on by Stan Nielson  \\nThe next day, Doctor Stan Nielson was called up to check on Maximoff, who detailed that she was about four months pregnant. Maximoff was completely delighted by all this, but Vision was concerned, due to the odd nature of her pregnancy, including her going further in stages. With the pregnancy occurring at a fast rate, Maximoff used her powers to build a room for the baby, while she and Vision debated the name, with Maximoff favoring Tommy, and Vision preferring Billy. Vision calculated that the baby should be born three days from then.\\n\\n     Maximoff\\'s powers act out of her control  \\nDue to the pregnancy\\'s acceleration, Maximoff began to get contractions, which caused her powers to go haywire. Maximoff became nervous whether this would alert the residents of their true nature, which led to Vision expanding further, noting that the recent unusual events caused him to think something was wrong in Westview. But this concerning behavior from Vision made Maximoff rewind reality so she could continue living her ideal reality. At that moment, Maximoff\\'s water broke, causing the plumbing to flood the house.\\n\\n     Maximoff gives birth to her twins  \\nVision rushed off to get Nielsen, leaving Maximoff at home, where she was soon joined by Geraldine, who Maximoff attempted to hide her pregnancy from, which became difficult, as she got closer to going into labor. As Maximoff listened to Geraldine, she noticed a stork walk around the house, which led to Geraldine discovering the truth. At that moment, Maximoff went into labor, so Geraldine helped deliver the baby, which she did successfully. Vision then arrived, but before the they could celebrate, Maximoff went into labor again, as she was having twins, who they named Tommy and Billy.[17]\\n\\nEjecting Geraldine\\n     Maximoff mentions Pietro Maximoff  \\n\\n\"I\\'m a twin.

His name was Pietro.\"\"He was killed by Ultron, wasn\\'t he?\"\"What did you just say?\"\\n―Wanda Maximoff and \"Geraldine\"[src]\\nWhile Maximoff and Geraldine watched the twins, Maximoff mentioned she was a twin, bringing up Pietro Maximoff, before singing a Sokovian lullaby to her children. \\n\\n     Maximoff questions Geraldine\\'s true identity  \\nGeraldine noted that Pietro was killed by Ultron, breaking Maximoff out of her daze, and causing her to interrogate Geraldine on how she knew about her brother. Geraldine attempted to put Maximoff at ease, but was demanded to leave, and when Maximoff noticed her necklace with a sword symbol, she grew more intent on knowing her true identity.[8] Maximoff realized that Geraldine was not from Westview, and because she was trespassing within her reality, Maximoff used her powers to eject Geraldine out of the town.\\n\\n     Maximoff returns to living out her reality  \\nMaximoff repaired the damaged walls with her powers, and then returned to her newborn twins, as Vision returned inside, asking about Geraldine. Maximoff told him that she returned home, but when she turned around, she was startled by Vision, who appeared as his corpse, causing her to look away in horror, but when she looked back, everything was normal again. Vision told Maximoff that they didn\\'t have to stay in Westview, but she refuted it, saying it was their home, and that she had everything under control.[18]\\n\\nRaising Tommy and Billy\\n     Maximoff and Vision are helped by Agnes  \\n\\n\"The two of you, you might fight over toys, but he\\'s always going to be your brother.

They then noticed that Tommy and Billy had aged-up to five years old.\\n\\n     Maximoff suggests no longer hiding to Vision  \\nMaximoff later discovered that her sons had brought home a dog, asking if they could keep it. When Agnes dropped by again with a dog house, and suggested the name \"Sparky,\" Maximoff almost revealed her powers in front of her, much to Vision\\'s concern. Maximoff claimed that she was tired of hiding, and felt Vision should embrace the same feelings, but he did not, and grew more worried. When Tommy and Billy asked once more if they could keep the dog, they aged themselves up again to ten years old, as Maximoff and Vision felt they were too young.\\n\\n     Maximoff talks to her children about family  \\nWhile Maximoff watched her children trained Sparky, they asked about their father\\'s whereabouts, as she had sent him off to work to distract him. This led to Maximoff talking to the boys about how she and Vision disagree occasionally, but it would only be temporary, just like how the boys would fight with each other, but still always be brothers. Tommy then asked his mother if she had a brother, so Maximoff told him about Pietro Maximoff, telling them that he was far away, and that it made her sad sometimes.[8]\\n\\nConfronting S.W.O.R.D.\\n     Maximoff disables a S.W.O.R.D. drone  \\n\\n\"This will be your only warning.

After throwing the destroyed drone back to S.W.O.R.D., Maximoff confronted Director Tyler Hayward, warning him to leave her alone, and that she won\\'t bother them if they didn\\'t bother her. Hayward refused Maximoff\\'s request, noting that she had taken an entire town hostage, to which Maximoff retorted that they were the ones with the guns pointed at her.\\n\\n     Maximoff speaks with Monica Rambeau  \\nRambeau intervened, asserting that Maximoff was the one in control, and upon recognizing her as \"Geraldine,\" Maximoff threateningly conjured a ball of psionic energy. Rambeau attempted to get through to Maximoff, claiming she didn\\'t know the drone was armed, and that Maximoff, being a telepath and having all the residents in her control, knew Rambeau was a S.W.O.R.D. agent all along, and trusted her to deliver her babies. Rambeau deduced that Maximoff, knew she was an ally that wanted to help her, but Maximoff told her she had everything she wanted, and no one was going to take it from her again. Maximoff then returned back into the Hex, briefly controlling the agents to aim at Hayward.[8]\\n\\nVision\\'s Confrontation\\n     Maximoff talks to her children about death  \\n\\n\"Vision...

Vision demanded to know what was outside of Westview, and exclaimed he didn\\'t know who he was, so Maximoff reassured him of who he was.\\n\\n     Maximoff is reunited with \"Pietro Maximoff\"  \\nUnconvinced, Vision asked why there were no children in Westview, irritating Maximoff as she continue to tell Vision she wasn\\'t controlling everything. Maximoff revealed that she wasn\\'t sure of how it all started, but Vision continued, telling her that what she was doing was wrong. At that moment, the doorbell rang, which Maximoff did not cause, although Vision did not believe her. Maximoff opened the door, but did not recognize the person standing before her, who revealed himself to be \"Pietro Maximoff\", although he looked different, to Maximoff\\'s shock.[8]\\n\\nHalloween\\n     Maximoff dresses up for Halloween  \\n\\n\"Just remember that this is a respectable family.

Herb asked if Maximoff wanted anything changed, but she reassured him that it was fine.\\n\\n     Maximoff witnesses her son gain powers  \\nDisappointed by \"Pietro\\'s\" influence on Tommy and Billy, Maximoff made them give back all the candy they stole, where she continued to question \"Pietro,\" who outlined his role that she wanted him to play. After asking him about his missing accent, \"Pietro\" then explained to Maximoff how after he was killed by Ultron, he heard her calling him, so he came to Westview, knowing she needed him. Suddenly, when her sons returned, they discovered that Tommy gained super speed, like his uncle, so she told him to take his brother with him when he runs off, and not to go past Ellis Avenue.[9]\\n\\nExpanding the Hex\\n     Maximoff and her \"brother\" discuss the Hex  \\n\\n\"Where\\'s your dad?\"Hey, don\\'t sweat it, sis.

Maximoff was interrupted by the sight of \"Pietro\" momentarily appearing as a bullet riddled corpse. much to her horror.\\n\\n     Maximoff expands the Hex to save Vision  \\nSuddenly, Maximoff heard Billy Maximoff frantically calling out to her, telling her that Vision was in trouble, having just acquired telepathy powers. Maximoff attempted to calm her son down, asking where Vision was, but she was angered when \"Pietro\" said that her husband couldn\\'t die twice, so she blasted him away. After telling him to focus, Billy then proceed to detail what he saw to his mother, resulting in her realizing he was outside the Hex. Maximoff then used her powers to freeze all the residents, and expand the Hex, saving Vision from death, and enveloping many S.W.O.R.D. agents.[9]\\n\\nLosing Control\\n     Maximoff noticing reality go out of control  \\n\\n\"I don\\'t understand what\\'s happening. Why it\\'s... Why it\\'s all falling apart and why... I can\\'t fix it.\"\"Do you think maybe this is what you deserve?\"\"What? You\\'re not supposed to talk.\"\\n―Wanda Maximoff and \"Cameraman\"[src]\\nAfter expanding the Hex, reality was transitioned into the 2000s, taking form as a mockumentary styled sitcom, where Maximoff, in a talking head, reflected on her actions. Alone in her bed, Maximoff ignored her sons, who came to her with problems. Maximoff soon came downstairs, deciding to isolate himself, where she noticed reality uncontrollably glitch out.\\n\\n     Maximoff confesses about her confusion  \\nDeciding not to worry about Vision\\'s whereabouts, Maximoff spoke to her children about how the man claiming to be Pietro Maximoff was not actually him, and that she didn\\'t have any answers on everything that was happening. They were then visited by Agnes, who decided to take care of Tommy and Billy for Maximoff so she could have time to herself. Maximoff continued to witness things inexplicably morph appearances, and when she talked about not knowing what was happening, her interviewer asked if it was what she deserved, to Maximoff\\'s confusion.\\n\\n     Maximoff faces off with Monica Rambeau  \\nLater, Maximoff was surprised by the arrival of Monica Rambeau, but immediately became angered when she brought up Vision and what Tyler Hayward was doing, having had enough of dealing with S.W.O.R.D.. Maximoff began to threaten Rambeau, but she withheld, which Rambeau noted was the difference between her and Hayward, and that he was making her to be the villain. Maximoff suggested that she may already be a villain, but Rambeau attempted to get through to her, only to be stopped by Agnes, who took Maximoff to her home.[10]\\n\\nLearning the Truth\\n     Maximoff learns \"Agnes\" is Agatha Harkness  \\n\\n\"Let go of my children.\"\"Oh, yes, your children. And Vision, and this whole little life you\\'ve made, this is Chaos Magic, Wanda. And that makes you the Scarlet Witch.\"\\n―Wanda Maximoff and Agatha Harkness[src]\\nUpon entering Agnes\\' house, Maximoff asked about her sons\\' whereabouts, so Agnes directed her to the basement. Maximoff discovered the basement to be a dark sanctum, which she explored, until she was soon joined by Agnes, who revealed herself to be a witch named Agatha Harkness who had been secretly influencing Maximoff\\'s reality.[10]\\n\\n     Maximoff is interrogated by Agatha Harkness  \\nLearning the truth about Harkness, Maximoff attempted to read her mind, but was unable to, so she once again asked about her children\\'s whereabouts, but when she went to use her powers, they did not work, as Harkness had cast a protection spell. Harkness restrained Maximoff, and detailed how she waited patiently, and worked slowly, including using a fake Pietro Maximoff to manipulate her, to figure out how Maximoff created the Hex, which was a combination of many spells being cast at once. However, she was unsuccessful, and was not able to get an answer from Maximoff.\\n\\n     Maximoff relives moments from her past  \\nHarkness recalled on what Maximoff said about only remembering feeling immense sadness before the Hex, and decided to enter her past to find the answer. Maximoff initially refused, but was forced when her children were threatened. Maximoff proceeded to live out the day her parents died, which were the origins of her witch abilities, then when she encountered the Mind Stone, which increased her power, then falling in love with Vision, and finally when she found Vision\\'s body at S.W.O.R.D. Headquarters, leading to her creating the Hex in Westview, due to all the built up trauma.\\n\\n     Maximoff is revealed to be the Scarlet Witch  \\nSnapping out of her past, Maximoff heard her sons calling out to her for help, so she rushed outside, where Harkness had them by the throats. Realizing the truth, Harkness explained how a being like Maximoff, which was perceived as a myth, was dangerous, having powers of spontaneous creation, which she had been using to live in a sitcom. Maximoff demanded that Harkness release her children, and she replied by telling her that her sons, Vision, and their reality were all Chaos Magic, declaring Maximoff as the Scarlet Witch.[1]\\n\\nPersonality\\n\\n\"I have what I want and no one will ever take it from me again.\"\\n―Scarlet Witch[src]\\nDue to childhood trauma from seeing her parents killed right in front of her, and the constant war-like state of her home, Wanda Maximoff had developed a very aggressive personality. From being involved in protests to volunteering for Wolfgang von Strucker\\'s experiments, and joining the Avengers, Maximoff has shown that she prefers to fight directly for what she believes in. Her passionate nature and willingness to engage in violence to achieve her goals led her to mistakenly side with Ultron, which deeply influenced much of her future actions.\\nHer passion was partly fueled by her hatred of the United States of America and Tony Stark and was strong enough to have her side with Ultron for what she believed to be the greater good. She was unfazed when Ultron killed von Strucker and was willing to send Hulk on a rampage in Johannesburg, costing the lives of both soldiers and civilians. Fortunately, she was not blinded completely by passion and was capable of reason, clearly being appalled by the level of destruction Ultron was trying to achieve, and promptly sided with the Avengers to make amends. After getting to know the Avengers, she has since let go of any grudge or hatred she previously held against the team as well as the United States.\\nDue to her past affiliation with Ultron and her role in the destruction of Sokovia, Maximoff carried a deep fear of making mistakes and was frequently wracked with guilt and remorse. Her self-doubt and guilt over the mistakes she has made have at times led her to inaction, even though she is generally action-oriented. Despite this, Hawkeye was able to talk her into action, affirming her desire to fight for what she feels is right, despite what others may think of her.\\nIn contrast with her brother, Scarlet Witch displays a more serious attitude and direct anger, not only against Tony Stark but against anyone that she perceives as her enemy, such as Klaue and Thanos. Her anger leads her to be vengeful, as demonstrated when she volunteered for experiments to become a weapon against the United States and Tony Stark, seeking out Ultron\\'s primary body in order to destroy him after he caused the death of her brother, and angrily telling Thanos that he could not understand her pain after she was forced to kill Vision in the attempt to stop him. In the past, she had no qualms about manipulating others mentally in order to achieve what she wanted, though she later regretted doing this.\\nMaximoff became considerably more mellow after joining the team, as she is seen to be more compassionate, level-headed, and less inclined to use the manipulative aspects of her abilities, such as fear projection and mind control. Driven by a desire to fight in the front lines rather than as passive support, Maximoff honed her powers to become more combat-oriented, focusing on energy blasts, throws, and barrier projection, relying less on her telepathic abilities. Having become less aggressive and more reluctant to do harm, she has not been seen using her mental manipulation powers since joining the Avengers. Additionally, she rarely uses her powers to deal out lethal force unless completely necessary, using her powers more often to incapacitate her opponents. However, she also is less inclined to hold back in a fight, even against fellow Avengers, as shown when she hurled Black Widow several feet when she attempted to overpower Hawkeye. She has shown a willingness to kill her enemies in extreme circumstances, as shown when she telekinetically threw a carving knife at a perceived assailant before realizing it was Hawkeye, and when she purposefully lifted Proxima Midnight into a Thresher and shredded her to stop the latter from killing Black Widow.\\nMaximoff grew to care for Vision during their time together. She was, however, disappointed that he was more loyal to Stark and the people of Earth than to her. However, in the aftermath of Avengers Civil War, she has put the grudge aside and developed strong romantic feelings for him to the point that, after she escaped from the Raft, she went off the grid with him to Europe and was in the beginning stages of starting a new life with him. Her feelings grew strong to the point that she tried her best to protect him from Thanos and the Black Order despite being at a great disadvantage, and refused to kill him until there was no alternative, resisting even when he himself agreed that his death was for the greater good of the universe. When forced to kill him, Maximoff openly wept as she was killing the being she loved more than anything else. Maximoff was horrified when Vision was briefly resurrected and emotionally devastated when he was killed a second time by Thanos, sitting at his side in mourning minutes before her death.\\nWhile initially hostile during the conflict with Ultron, Maximoff grew to have a strong bond with Hawkeye, who serves as a brotherly figure in her life, especially after losing Pietro. Hawkeye was responsible for encouraging her to act in two separate situations where she is overcome by her guilt, that being the attack on Sokovia and his attempt to extract her from the Avengers\\' Compound. In the aftermath of the Battle of Earth, where Hawkeye was in need of comfort after losing Black Widow, Maximoff was there, by his side, to quiet his worries.\\nUpon coming back to life and returning to Earth to fight against Thanos and his armies, Maximoff displayed an overwhelming vehemence towards the alien warlord, tempered by a subtle confidence. Her presence and movements were more deliberate and forceful, unlike the relative apprehension she displayed in her earlier appearances. This was most evident when Thanos was trying to break through her protections, Maximoff gave him an almost mocking smirk before forcefully swatting away his weapon with relative ease.\\n\\nPowers and Abilities\\nPowers\\n\\n\"Wanda manipulates people\\'s perceptions, makes them hallucinate.\"\"Yeah, that\\'s her whole bag. If all the sets and props and wardrobe were solid matter, that would mean she\\'s wielding an insane amount of power.\"\\n―Jimmy Woo and Darcy Lewis[src]\\nPsionics: As a result of exposure to the cosmic energies from the Scepter, which contained the Mind Stone, Wanda Maximoff gained an array of psionic powers. These powers manifest as a luminescent vapor or mist of red hue emanating from her hands and body, resembling the natural Chaos Magic she was born with. When using her telepathic abilities, Maximoff\\'s irises glow a dark red color. When using her telekinetic abilities, her irises glow a bright red color. Her power signature is similar to that of the Mind Stone, as she gained her powers from it. Maximoff\\'s powers are reliant on movement and focus, which means her enemies or opponents can stop her from using her powers by disrupting her concentration or restricting her movement. War Machine was able to incapacitate her momentarily using a sonic cannon and her powers were restricted with a straitjacket and specialized collar during her time on the Raft. During the Battle of Wakanda, Proxima Midnight was able to ambush Maximoff by striking her on the head with the hilt of her sword, which disrupted Maximoff\\'s focus and stopped her from using her powers momentarily. During the Battle of Earth, Wanda\\'s powers had grown so strong that she was able to single-handedly defeat Thanos, a feat that Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America via Mjølnir failed to accomplish. These enhanced powers are magical in nature, although she has never received formal training, making them unrefined, especially when compared to Doctor Strange.[19]\\nPsionic Energy Manipulation:      Scarlet Witch generating psionic energy  Maximoff can project energy blasts, streams, waves and bolts of her own psionic and telekinetic energy, allowing her to hit, push/pull or blow away her targets, potentially exerting enough force to destroy them. This energy manifests in any shape or form, outlining her telekinetic spheres of influence, as the energy is visible in a reddish color. When her energy hits a target, she can use her telekinesis to inflict further damage. Sometimes, Maximoff will lose control of her powers due to emotional turmoil, such as when she unleashed a wave of red psionic force that tore apart and disintegrated surrounding Ultron sentries when she sensed her brother Pietro Maximoff\\'s death, letting out a scream of anguish. Maximoff proved herself capable of destroying the Mind Stone, due to her powers having a similar energy signature. She could also use her psionic energy streams to enhance the powers behind her attacks, such as when she first used her telekinesis to bring Vision to his knees and then use a dense stream of energy to force him through several floors and several feet into the ground. During the attack on Vision, Maximoff utilized this power to knock back Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive using a bolt of psionic energy, and later used another blast to throw Corvus Glaive through the wall of a bell tower. She also showed the capability of multitasking while using her abilities, as she simultaneously held back Thanos with a stream from one hand while destroying the Mind Stone with a stream of energy from her other hand. She was also able to use her telekinesis with one hand to stop Thanos\\' sword in midair while also using a powerful energy blast with her other hand to cleave it into two pieces. In her second encounter with Thanos, Maximoff\\'s energy blasts were powerful enough to force the Mad Titan to go on the defensive against her and were enough to knock him back and make him stumble backwards even when he blocked them with his sword. Maximoff was also able to push Monica Rambeau out of her reality with a powerful energy blast that sent her through several walls, including the barrier that divides Westview from the outside world; while leaving Rambeau completely physically unharmed and send \"Pietro Maximoff\" flying with a powerful blast. She can also utilize her psionic energy in a neurological way to manipulate the thoughts and memories of others, akin to telepathy.\\nTelekinesis: Maximoff has the ability to move, levitate and otherwise manipulate objects using her psionic energy in a remote manner without the need for her energy to first be projected from her hands. Maximoff uses this energy to affect and control molecules and particles, allowing her to fully control matter and energy. Maximoff started training this power by moving wooden blocks around while imprisoned in Wolfgang von Strucker\\'s secret facility. Maximoff pulled them apart with her power, and suspended them in the air. Maximoff used this power to stop an off-rail train in Seoul, tear apart Ultron sentries and rip out the central processor of Ultron\\'s primary body, which was made of vibranium. Maximoff\\'s telekinesis can control a soldier\\'s gunfire and throw him away, lift Captain America into the air to enter a building, hurl aside Black Widow and Black Panther, hurl cars at Iron Man and Spider-Man, extract and dissipate an enormous amount of gas, and even hold up a collapsed watchtower for several minutes to allow Captain America and Bucky to escape. Maximoff was also capable of using her energy to slow the chemical reaction within Crossbone\\'s explosive vest by reducing the particles\\' kinetic energy on a molecular level, although it caused her great strain due to the massive energy the reaction induced once it had started. She was even able to bring the immensely powerful Vision to his knees and blast him vertically down through a building\\'s many floors. Her telekinesis is powerful enough to bend vibranium, as she managed to rip open the chest of Ultron\\'s damaged primary body to summon his central processor to her hand, and was even strong enough to shatter the Mind Stone. She was also able to stop a massive line of Threshers and redirect them at Thanos\\' Outriders, as well as hold back a Chitauri Leviathan. During her second fight with Thanos, she lifted and flung large portions of debris at him. She then was able to use her telekinesis to hold back Thanos\\' sword even with the Titan using both of his arms in an attempt to overpower her, and was able to weaken its structural integrity, causing cracks to appear in it, before finally using an energy blast to cleave it in two. She then incapacitated him by lifting him into the air and began to crush his body, snapping off significant portions of his armor. She displayed great degrees of precision with her telekinesis, such as when she used it to heal Vision by telekinetically repairing his body on a molecular level. Maximoff was also precise enough to use her energy to remove a copious volume of poisonous gas by spreading her energy throughout every molecule of gas and making it dissipate into the atmosphere. Maximoff was able to use her telekinesis to organize the dishes in her kitchen, use it to help herself handle all the kitchen items while preparing a dinner, rebuild part of her house after having expelled Monica Rambeau, lift Rambeau into the air to get her out of her house before dropping her to the ground, open a door in S.W.O.R.D. Headquarters, and break the glass of a large window to access the lab where Vision\\'s body was being disassembled.\\nDisintegration: Maximoff is capable of using her energy in such an acute telekinetic way that she is able to completely disintegrate objects on a molecular level, as she did with several Ultron Sentries after sensing her brother\\'s death.\\n     Scarlet Witch creates a psionic force-field  Force Field Generation: Maximoff is able to create a highly durable barrier of energy that she can shape and conform as needed. She used it to grab and break apart targets, protect others from enemy fire, contain a target or to cover and deflect attacks from enemies, such as Ultron\\'s sentries. Like any physical barriers, the barrier could be broken with extreme brute force, as the Sentries were able to eventually break it. During her time as an Avenger, Maximoff learned to project her energy around herself, constructing a close-to-the-body psionic armor to protect herself from extreme impacts, such as falls from great heights or blows from superhumanly strong combatants, increasing her durability to a significant degree. This allowed her to land safely whenever she crash lands, as well as defending her against the might of superhuman combatants, such as Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive who sent her and Vision crashing through a glass roof after being shot down by Proxima Midnight\\'s spear.\\nFlight: Maximoff is able to use this power to move through the air and simulate flight, in order to hover and safely float back to the ground. The use of this power manifests as a blast of psionic energy expelled from her hands onto the ground to propel herself up in the air, with a second blast used to slow her momentum as she approaches ground allowing her to land safely. It operates more like an enhanced leap similarly to Hulk, thanks to the force of gravity pushing her down. Maximoff\\'s power grew over time to the point where she could project herself, along with Vision, far higher into the air and for much longer than before. After her resurrection and empowerment, she was able to effortlessly levitate several feet into the air while simultaneously lifting two massive pieces of rubble, no longer needing to actively project energy from her hands to levitate herself, and later flew through the air to intercept a Leviathan before it could attack Valkyrie. During her discussion with Vision, Maximoff was able to float without being propelled by her psionic energy.\\n     Scarlet Witch manipulates Black Widow  Mental Manipulation: Maximoff was able to deploy a form of mental manipulation, often as a type of illusory hypnosis, using the same neuro-electric interface that is the basis of her telepathic powers. This power can be hypnotic in nature as shown when she used it against the Avengers in South Africa, placing them in a sort of trance while she viewed the Avengers\\' memories. When using her power, her irises sometimes glow a dark reddish color, especially when she concentrates it on specific targets. She was able to use this ability to cripple the Avengers, forcing them each to recall the darker events of their pasts and placing them inside daydream-like visions that rendered them nearly helpless. When this ability is in use, Maximoff\\'s reddish energy takes a more mist-like form, floating into the head of the victim in the form of neurons. The effects also distort the victim\\'s iris coloration, causing them to shine a dark reddish color. This also allows her to control other people\\'s actions, as she did with a considerable number of civilians in Sokovia to aid in their evacuation, causing them to experience a form of sleepwalking and making them all get up and leave the city. Maximoff\\'s mental power is even strong enough to reverse the effects of the Mind Stone, one of the most powerful objects in existence, as shown when she freed Helen Cho from the stone\\'s control. She can also manipulate the memory, thoughts, actions, emotions, and senses of others at will, as well as to induce sleep or pain and create illusions without any difficulty. After her change of allegiance, she is no longer shown using this area of her powers. Maximoff could use her telepathy to affect the Mind Stone, such as when she forced used her power to make Vision phase through Hawkeye to release him. Maximoff can also use her psionic energy to read the Mind Stone and state that she felt Vision\\'s consciousness. Maximoff was able to use this power to cause several S.W.O.R.D. agents to point their guns at Tyler Hayward.\\nEmotional Manipulation: With her mental powers, Maximoff often used it in order to elicit fear or emotional pain in a person in the form of nightmarish hallucinations that could stun and weaken even an individual as powerful as Thor. These visions can depict things that a person fears, regrets, or general disturbances, though the nature of it is not up to Maximoff. She does seem to be able to know what her victim is seeing and be inside the vision with them without them being aware of her presence.\\nTelepathy: Due to her ability to interact mentally with others, Maximoff can read minds, communicate telepathically and experience the memories and thoughts of others. She also used this ability to temporarily see into Ultron\\'s mind whilst he was uploading his consciousness into the android body of what would later become Vision and it was thanks to this that she was able to discover his genocidal intentions and rebel against him. Maximoff can also sense the minds and emotions of those around her as she could see Stark\\'s fear in their first encounter and sensed Quicksilver\\'s death, knowing exactly what happened to him as if she had been there in person.\\n\\n\"You have no idea how dangerous you are. You\\'re supposed to be a myth. A being capable of spontaneous creation, and here you are, using it to make breakfast for dinner.\"\\n―Agatha Harkness to Wanda Maximoff[src]\\n     Maximoff displaying her Chaos Magic  \\nChaos Magic Manipulation: As revealed by Agatha Harkness, in addition to the psionic abilities granted by the Mind Stone, Maximoff was born with latent magical abilities that were later amplified through her exposure to the Stone. Able to harness Chaos Magic, Maximoff was the realisation of the myth of the Scarlet Witch, a being capable of spontaneous creation. Her magic is primarily composed of the same red energy that powers her psionic powers, although certain abilities within the Hex could also be used with no apparent energy discharge.\\nReality Manipulation: Maximoff can warp reality. She accomplishes this by manipulating molecular polarity, allowing her numerous other capabilities. Maximoff\\'s reality warping abilities began initially on a small scale. However, as time progressed, her  powers have grown exponentially. Using this power, Maximoff was able to take control of Westview by placing a hexagonal force field around the town called the Hex, which emits a type of radiation known as CMBR, a remnant radiation from the Big Bang. Inside the Hex, Maximoff has absolute power and can change anything to suit her thinking, being able to create a perfect world based on classic sitcoms, as well as use her powers to rewrite reality and make any person and any object  adapt to the time in which they were live in Westview, demonstrated when she had Monica Rambeau\\'s bulletproof vest changed to fit the clothing of her world of classic sitcoms. In fact, every rewritten object inside the Hex, when it exits Westview, remains the same as it was inside. Although at first the Hex was only found around Westview, when Vision came out of the barrier and nearly died, Maximoff expanded the Hex to save him, also causing everything in his path to be rewritten, transforming the S.W.O.R.D. base into a circus and its agents into clowns. The Hex is able to do this even if Wanda is not aware of it, as the Hex began to immediately disassemble Vision\\'s vibranium body after he left, but Wanda was unaware of it happening.\\nConjuration: With a snap of her fingers, Maximoff was able to conjure an elegant dress to wear during dinner with the Harts, and later, with a wave of her finger she was able to create wedding rings for herself and Vision. During the magic show on Westview, Maximoff was able to conjure a small crane to cover up Vision\\'s flight. Later on she was able to create a dog collar for Sparky. It was later revealed this was how she was able to bring back Vision, conjuring a copy of her deceased lover within Westview with chaos magic, as well as creating a house for them to live in.\\nTime Manipulation: Maximoff reverted a whole chicken into its egg form and later reversed the entire flow of time inside her reality by saying \"no\" in response to a S.W.O.R.D. agent crawling out of a sewer. While expanding the Hex to save Vision, Maximoff caused time in Westview to completely stop.\\nTeleportation: During the talent show she instantly transported Geraldine from backstage into the magic box.\\nTransmutation: Maximoff changed her dresses and transformed a real piano into a fake cardboard cutout. She also turned her and Vision\\'s beds into a single bed and brought color to Westview. Maximoff was able to make herself four months pregnant inadvertently, and also caused her to give birth at a logarithmic rate. Maximoff also brought fake butterflies on a mobile to life without meaning to. When dealing with pain from her contractions Maximoff inadvertently changed her coat several times and also accidentally brought life to a stork from a painting. However, when Wanda tried to get rid of the stork, she was unsuccessful, as the most she could do was cause a puff of red dust to erupt around it. As her mental stability deteriorated, she began to inadvertently change objects in her home into their versions from previous sitcom eras.\\nElectricity Manipulation: Maximoff turned a light on and off with her hand and later, while suffering from fake contractions, Maximoff caused a power surge that intensified the light from a ceiling light and caused a power outage that affected the whole block.\\nWeather Manipulation: When Maximoff\\'s water broke she caused a rainstorm to erupt within the Vision Residence. After the rain stopped, she generated intense winds to pour in from outside in order to dry herself, Vision, and her house.\\nFire Manipulation: While experiencing contractions, Maximoff ignited a fire within the fireplace and caused it to intensify before dying down.\\nAbilities\\n\\n\"She could have taken out Thanos on her own if he hadn\\'t initiated a blitz. I mean, nobody else came close.\"\\n―Monica Rambeau to Jimmy Woo[src]\\n     Scarlet Witch fighting Thanos  \\nExpert Combatant: Maximoff was originally a poor fighter, having no combat skills or formal training. However, with years of experience, she developed a fighting style in which she would infuse her psionic energy into her hands to greatly enhance her hand-to-hand combat skills and allow her to parry attacks from bladed weapons without suffering any harm due to her psionic energy protecting her hands from damage. Her combat instincts were also honed to the point she could react to and halt an explosion, parry attacks from Proxima Midnight, and catch Thanos\\' double-edged sword moments before it could strike her. By the time of the Infinity War, Maximoff had become skilled enough that she was able to engage Proxima Midnight, a combatant deadly enough to overpower Okoye and Black Widow, in close-quarters combat and defend herself adequately, although she was nearly killed several times. After being resurrected, Maximoff, now more powerful than ever and fueled by rage over Vision\\'s death, was able to face Thanos directly in close range combat, managing to subdue and very nearly kill him, had it not been for his desperate air strike that knocked her back.\\nSpy: Given that she was on the run from the government like her teammates, Maximoff was taught strategies to hide in plain sight by Black Widow, such as masking her thick Eastern European accent with an American one.[20]\\nMusician: Maximoff plays the acoustic guitar, as evidenced by the presence of one in her room at the New Avengers Facility.[4]\\nMultilingualism: Maximoff is fluent in her native Sokovian and English. She initially spoke English with a heavy Sokovian accent, and although it slightly faded by the time of the attack on the IFID Headquarters, Black Widow taught her how to speak with a convincing American accent by the time of the Attack on Vision. Despite years without speaking her native language or even English with a Sokovian accent, Maximoff was still able to sing a Sokovian lullaby to her twin sons. Wanda\\'s accent resurfaced when she confronted S.W.O.R.D. outside of Westview. She could also speak some Spanish.\\nEquipment\\nUniform\\n\\n\"Is that my jacket?\"\"She\\'s with us.\"\"It still doesn\\'t explain the jacket.\"\\n―Black Widow and Captain America[src]\\nSokovia Uniform: After deciding to fight with the Avengers against Ultron in Sokovia, Maximoff wore her black dress, black leather wristers, and black boots, with knee-high torn stockings, along with her jewelry. She was also given Natasha Romanoff\\'s red leather jacket by her brother to wear over her dress, not actually having an official uniform to wear.\\nAvengers Uniform: When Maximoff became an official member of the Avengers, she was provided her own uniform. This consisted of a black leather suit with a red corset and a red leather jacket over it that had two strips down the front. The uniform included elbow high black leather fingerless gloves, and tall, heeled boots with red piping on top of them. This uniform would soon be replaced.\\nSecond Avengers Uniform: Not long after joining the Avengers, Maximoff would receive a new uniform, similar to her previous one.

Later it was discovered that she was, in fact, the daughter of Magneto and his wife Magda Lehnsherr in Vision and the Scarlet Witch #4 (1983), 19 years after Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver\\'s first appearance. In Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #7 (2014) and then Uncanny Avengers #4 (2015), it is confirmed not only are they not related to Magneto but they are also not mutants, as the High Evolutionary was the one that genetically altered them as infants, giving them their powers, before returning them to their parents, the Maximoffs, whom they briefly believed to be their real parents again.[21] Later on, it was revealed in Scarlet Witch #4 (2016) that Wanda and Pietro were actually the children of Natalya Maximoff, the sister of Django, who was also a witch who went by the moniker of Scarlet Witch. Natalya and Django, in turn, are the children of a man called the Scarlet Warlock, and Django and Marya took in Natalya\\'s twins after the deaths of their own, Ana and Mateo.\\nAlthough Maximoff\\'s comic book moniker, Scarlet Witch, was never spoken by anyone during the course of the films, Iron Man did once disparagingly refer to her as a \"witch.\"[3] It was later in Previously On of the TV series WandaVision that Maximoff is called by her moniker for the first time.\\nMaximoff\\'s Halloween costume sported in All-New Halloween Spooktacular! is accurately based on her comic-book outfit. According to Maximoff, the costume represent a traditional Sokovian fortune teller; this is a reference to her biological mother Natalya Maximoff, an alleged Romani fortune teller who was actually the original Scarlet Witch and wore the same outfit as her daughter.\\nMaximoff\\'s stage name \"Glamour\" in Don\\'t Touch That Dial is a reference to Glynis Zarkov, a Leonia resident with superpowers, that she hide under the guise of the stage magician \"Glamor\", alongside her husband Ilya.\\nIn the comics, Wanda married Vision, and had two sons with him before their marriage dissolved. Their sons erased from existence, but were reincarnated as Wiccan and Speed.\\nWanda is 5\\'6\".\\nBehind the Scenes\\nElizabeth Olsen was uncredited for her appearance in Captain America: The Winter Soldier.\\nBoth Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were originally going to appear in the post-credits scene for Guardians of the Galaxy.\\nLindsay Lohan, Sasha Pieterse and Saoirse Ronan were considered for the role of Scarlet Witch before Elizabeth Olsen was cast.\\nDespite the rights to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch being formerly shared between 20th Century Fox and Marvel Studios, the former owned all rights to Marvel Comics mutants, hence why the MCU incarnations could not legally be identified as mutants until the acquisition of 20th Century Fox by Walt Disney Studios.\\nWanda Maximoff speaks with a thick Eastern European accent in Avengers: Age of Ultron, which was toned down in Captain America: Civil War, but has an American accent in Avengers: Infinity War. Joe and Anthony Russo explained that this was a deliberate decision made by the character in-universe to make herself less recognizable and that she learned the skill from Natasha Romanoff.[22]\\nElizabeth Olsen and Joss Whedon coined the term \"wiggly-woo\" for the hand gestures Wanda employs to inflict her powers. Olsen had the assistance of choreographer Jennifer White to plan the movements that would appear on screen.[23]\\nOlivia Jackson, Sarah Molasky, Jennifer White, C.C. Ice, Hayley Wright and Karin Justman were stunt doubles for Elizabeth Olsen in the role of Scarlet Witch.\\nEvie Wray, Ashley Lyn Blair and Delly Allen were stand-ins for Elizabeth Olsen in the role of Scarlet Witch.\\nLaura Waggott was a double for Elizabeth Olsen in the role of Scarlet Witch.\\nIn a behind the scenes featurette of Captain America: Civil War that showcased Vision and Scarlet Witch\\'s relationship, Vision stated that her powers were \"to manipulate molecular polarity, allowing her to alter reality.\"[24] This is a reference to Scarlet Witch\\'s powers in the comics.\\nElizabeth Olsen has stated that she does not like her corset due to it revealing too much cleavage, compared to other female characters being covered up.[25]\\nIn an interview with Comicbook.com, Kevin Feige stated that the Scarlet Witch\\'s powers are, in fact, Magic: \"Her powers, she\\'s never had any training, I\\'m talking about Scarlet Witch. She never had any training; she\\'s figuring it out. Arguably, you could say that that\\'s why her powers are much more chaotic and much more loose in the way that we showcased those light effects. In [Doctor Strange], some of what you might see today, even the cover of Entertainment Weekly, it\\'s much tighter. It\\'s all about focus. It\\'s all about pulling energies from other dimensions in an organized and purposeful fashion, which is why they can do a lot more than she can in, at least, a much more precise way.\"[19]\\nReferences\\n\\n\\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe wiki has a collection of images and media related to Scarlet Witch.\\n\\n\\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe wiki has a collection of quotes related to Scarlet Witch.\\n\\n\\n↑ 1.00 1.01 1.02 1.03 1.04 1.05 1.06 1.07 1.08 1.09 1.10 WandaVision: 1.08: Previously On\\n\\n↑ 2.0 2.1 Captain America: The Winter Soldier Mid-credits Scene\\n\\n↑ 3.00 3.01 3.02 3.03 3.04 3.05 3.06 3.07 3.08 3.09 3.10 3.11 3.12 3.13 3.14 3.15 3.16 3.17 3.18 3.19 Avengers: Age of Ultron\\n\\n↑ 4.00 4.01 4.02 4.03 4.04 4.05 4.06 4.07 4.08 4.09 4.10 Captain America: Civil War\\n\\n↑ 5.0 5.1 5.2 5.3 5.4 5.5 Avengers: Infinity War\\n\\n↑ 6.0 6.1 6.2 6.3 WandaVision: 1.01: Filmed Before a Live Studio Audience\\n\\n↑ 7.0 7.1 7.2 7.3 7.4 7.5 WandaVision: 1.02: Don\\'t Touch That Dial\\n\\n↑ 8.0 8.1 8.2 8.3 8.4 8.5 8.6 WandaVision: 1.05: On a Very Special Episode...\\n\\n↑ 9.0 9.1 9.2 9.3 9.4 WandaVision 1.06: All-New Halloween Spooktacular!\\n\\n↑ 10.0 10.1 10.2 WandaVision: 1.07: Breaking the Fourth Wall\\n\\n↑ Avengers: Age of Ultron Prelude - This Scepter\\'d Isle\\n\\n↑ 12.0 12.1 Avengers: Age of Ultron Deleted Scene\\n\\n↑ Captain America: Road to War\\n\\n↑ Black Widow Prelude\\n\\n↑ Avengers: Infinity War Prelude\\n\\n↑ 16.0 16.1 Avengers: Endgame\\n\\n↑ WandaVision: 1.03: Now in Color\\n\\n↑ WandaVision: 1.04: We Interrupt This Program\\n\\n↑ 19.0 19.1 Marvel Hits the Reset Button — Kevin Feige Confirms Scarlet Witch Is Magical After All\\n\\n↑ Infinity War Directors Answer The Fans\\' 18 Biggest Questions\\n\\n↑ No Longer Mutants.
